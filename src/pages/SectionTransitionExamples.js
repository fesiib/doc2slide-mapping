        <div>
            <p>
                Please specify <b> not more than 5-6 transitions </b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It would be great to give some specific examples, but...
            </p>
            <p>
                We are worried that we might bias you.
            </p>
            <p>
                So in simple words, it can be a major topic/section transitions that can be detected from slides {"&"} scripts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Very simple transition is on Page 1 - Title. It is automatically labeled by us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another simple transition can be the last "Thank You"-like slide.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you see Outline Slide in the presentation, please feel free to use it for transition detection.
            </p>
            <p>
                But in general, we do not constrain you to any specific definition of transition.
