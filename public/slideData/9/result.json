And to remind you, a JND is the minimal amount of distance that two colors need to be apart such that that difference is detected half the time. So looking at this graph, we can see that colors become more discriminable as mark size increases, because a lower value means more discriminable.

The X axis here shows the percentage of the time that a particular shape was perceived as larger than other shapes of the exact same size. So if there was no bias due to shape, we would expect these values to hover around 50%. But we see significant variation from this threshold. Now if we look at the mean size bias for the filled shapes and compare that to the unfilled shapes, we generally see that the filled shapes are perceived as larger than their unfilled counterparts. For example, the filled circle is perceived as larger in 67% of trials, while the unfilled circle is only perceived as larger in 49% of trials. So this pattern supports our hypothesis that denser shapes would be perceived as larger. But we don't see the same pattern in open shapes. For example, the T crossing is seen as larger in 82% of trials, while the denser 8 prong asterisk is seen as larger in only 54% of trials.

And thanks to my advisor, Danielle Safer for her support on this project. And thanks to the NSF for funding this work. And I'd be happy to take any questions. (audience applauding) - [Moderator] Thank you. We have time for a couple questions. Over there, yes? Please remember to state your name. - [Dan] Hi, Dan Russel from Google. I'm wondering in your Mechanical Turk studies, to what extent you controlled for different conditions of the displays, because you don't know who you're getting really. They could have an ancient display. They could be running on a CRT for all you know. And so I've noticed when I've done my own studies like this, that there's huge variation between monitors, and I worry that that might affect some of these results, because for example, in some of the whiter colors we've seen, they just disappear if the monitor is not tilted at exactly correct angle. So how did you account for that kind of differences? - So that's a great point, and it is a trade-off for sure. It's a trade-off basically between control over viewing conditions. And I should say we didn't really apply strict control over viewing conditions through this study. But it's a trade-off of control over viewing conditions for more ecological validity, because our goal here is to not necessarily to learn the precise perceptual mechanisms at play with some of these interactions, but to really give visualization designers a more practical guide to use to improve their encodings. And so visualization designers also do not know the hardware setups of their users. And so it's definitely a trade-off and a limitation of the study, but we think that basically we recruited a very large number of participants to help mitigate that a little bit, and also we wanna just focus on the more practical guidelines to help real world designers. - [Audience Member] (mumbles) from the University of St Andrews. I was wondering, 'cause there's potentially a lot of combinations here, of visual variables that affect other variables. And just by showing the non-symmetry, you just multiply the whole thing by two. I was wondering whether you had any thoughts about how we can deal, not individually as researchers, but as a community to come up with models that are a little bit more comprehensive. How are we gonna build up this knowledge so that we get better, and it's not one individual study after another that we cannot combine? - Yeah, that's a great point. Basically, if we're able to get sort of an intuition as to the deeper causes of some of these interferences in perceptions, then we perhaps can run more control like vision-science-oriented experiments, kind of related to this previous question where we maybe strap people's heads in and get a real solid intuition of what's happening with the visual system. Then maybe we can run sort of a broader experiment that allows us to build more generalizable models, instead of, like you're saying, having to run specific experiment after specific experiment so I think, experiments like these might give us insight into how we can design future experiments to help address that. But I think it's a great point, yeah. - [Audience Member] Thank you. - [Moderator] And that's (coughs), excuse me, that's time.
