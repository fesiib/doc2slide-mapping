It's one of the theories that could be used to form the framework you described. - So the paper goes through a set of different theories. Kind of looking at how they deal with habits, and we didn't feel like self-determination theory really helped us to explain habitual behavior. So I think self-determination theory tends to focus more on conscious feelings of whether you can achieve a given goal or not, or how your intentions formed. So, what we tried to do was to pick the theories that we thought together, and gave people the framework to be able to think about both conscious and non-conscious approaches to behavior change. - Thank you. - Hi, Dominic DiFranzo at Cornell University.
