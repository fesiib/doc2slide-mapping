    "text": "ABSTRACT Current haptic feedback techniques on handheld devices are applied to the finger pad or the palm of the user. These state-of-the-art approaches are coarse-grained and tend to be intrusive, rather than subtle. In contrast, we present a new feedback technique that applies stimuli around the periphery of the finger pulp, demonstrating how this can provide rich, nuanced haptic information. We use a reconfigurable haptic device employing a ferromagnetic marble for back-of-the device handheld use, which, for the first time, probes, without instrumenting the user, the periphery of the distal phalanx with localised stimulation. We present the design-space afforded by this new technique and evaluate the human-factors of finger-peripheral touch interaction in a controlled userstudy. We report results with marbles of different diameters, speeds and a combination of poking, lateral vibration and patterns; present the resulting design guidelines for fingerperiphery haptic feedback; and, illustrate its potential with use case scenarios."

      "text": "Haptic feedback is widely available in commercial handheld devices including smartphones and game-controllers. Typically, this feedback has been used to provide the user with either a touch input confirmation during a finger-press or to provide a tactile notification to draw the attention of the user to an alert or message. In current commercial devices, the haptic stimulation for touch confirmation is applied on the finger pad, i.e. the underside of the pulp at the end of the finger. For tactile notification, the user receives the haptic stimulation in their hand if they are holding the device, or to the body or leg if the device is in the coat or trousers pocket. Currently, the stimulation is generated using small vibration motors that are programmed to provide vibrotactile feedback. The granularity of both these forms of feedback is relatively coarse. To provide more subtle and finer-grained haptic outputs, researchers have considered a range of fingerpad based displays [2, 12, 28]; and grasp oriented outputs on mobile devices through dynamic haptic systems at the edge of the mobile devices by changing their physical shape [8, 19]."

In this work, inspired by reconfigurable approach, we have developed a tactile element for back-of-device pleasant and useful interactions as illustrated in the following scenario:"

The periphery of the finger pad is mostly concentrated with type-2 mechanoreceptors. While less sensitive than the finger pad itself, it has the ability to discriminate between light touches, skin stretches and tapping [11, 31]. In this paper, we leverage it as a continuous surface to apply localized spatio-temporal haptic stimulation and explore the extent to which feedback on it can be perceived by users in a controlled laboratory experiment. Our goal is to rigorously scope the possible stimulation dimensions for usable perceptions while the finger pad is touching a surface. To do this we have built a motion controlled marble-based device and explore different factors such as the localization, marble size and motion speed. We present the results of the empirical user study, design guidelines to shape future deployments and illustrate the use of this new system through interaction and application scenarios."

This stimulus is coarse, and is generated by a small eccentric rotating mass vibration motor or a linear resonant actuator (as used in the Apple Taptic Engine) [5]. Poupyrev et al. developed a piezoelectric bending actuator (Touch Engine) for a similar effect [23]. In spite of being coarse, such tactile feedback has been shown to provide many useful applications. Complex vibration patterns were presented in Ambient Touch for intelligent touch notification, touch monitoring and tactile feedback during gesture control, for instance [22]. Vibrotactile feedback has also been shown to complement other output modalities, as in their combination with GUI elements [21]. In this case, as with others of this class, the user’s palm of the device holding hand also receives the stimuli as opposed to a highly localized feedback."

      "text": "Instead of vibrating the entire device, tactile stimuli can be generated on the device’s surface. In the electrovibration technique, then, tactile feedback is given through the capacitive coupling with the finger pad when the user slides the finger on the dielectric surface with a conductive under layer [2, 24]. Meanwhile, in the electrocutaneous stimulation technique, a mild DC current pulse is passed through the finger pad to create tactile sensation when the user touches the conductive surface [12]. In [28] an electric spark with mild AC current pulses is used to stimulate a tactile sensation when the finger is hovering over the conductive surface. All of these techniques use transparent surfaces and are particularly useful for touch interaction for a front of screen task, e.g. , for touch confirmation on content notification. In the case where the user is performing a task (e.g. typing on the keyboard and receiving haptic confirmations) it might be confusing and intrusive if additional haptic notifications (such as the ones in our scenario) are presented via the same medium. To overcome this, we, like others are considering"

There are many other implementations on the edges of devices to stimulate different haptic perceptions.

Furthermore, unlike shiftIO and the tactile watch, the tactile element is not designed to feel like a “bump”. That is, we move ball bearings of different sizes in different patterns on a flat surface. We stimulate the periphery of the finger pulp with these patterns to convey a range of tactile stimuli. In all of the previous literature, the haptic feedback in handheld devices is focussed on the finger pad or the palm. Haptic stimulation applied to the periphery of the finger pulp has not been reported. We believe that our technique could offer two main advantages. The first advantage is that it offers an additional peripheral channel for tactile feedback near the finger pad. The second is the ergonomic advantage where the users could receive multiple notifications without changing their grip while holding the device."

The device controls the 2D position of a ball bearing within a 5cm-side square area. The motors were placed on each side of the square area and connected to an Arduino. Each opposite pair was bound to a perpendicular metallic rod and controlled the position of the rod along the side. A 3D printed platform was created to slide along the rods sitting at the intersection point. Neodymium magnets were glued atop of the platform. The whole device was enclosed in a laser cut box. A ferromagnetic ball bearing is placed on the box cover, with the magnets below it under the box cover. Due to the strong magnetic attraction, moving the platform rolled the ball bearing on the box cover. To control the position of the ball, we developed a C++ application with the Qt framework that communicated via serial port of the computer with the Arduino."

A marble with 7 mm diameter was chosen which was the common size for most participants. The motion of the marble was captured 1080×1920 high definition at 250 frames per second using a Sony RX10 III camera. Each frame of the movies was converted to a grey scale image and the motion was tracked using the imfindcircles function in Matlab. The distance was calibrated using the dimensions of the enclosure. We implemented two speed modes, slow and fast, based on a pilot study to test binary detection with the users. Figure 4 (a) shows the measured motion of the marble in both speed modes along one axis of the stage using two of the four linear actuators. The speed values were measured to be 10.8 mm/s and 21.4 mm/s in slow and fast modes. The noise amplified by five times and offset of 5 mm is shown in Figure 4 (a). We observed the 1/f noise below 10 Hz in the noise spectrum. There was also a small peak in the noise spectrum around 6 Hz. The standard deviation of the noise was 0.26 mm. Both the speed and vibration are generated by the stage. Similar speed and vibration were measured with marbles of different sizes. We observed similar performance when the marble motion was controlled along the other axis of the stage using the other two linear actuators. The general motion of the marble is controlled by triggering the two axes alternatively. This created minor oscillations in the marble motion. We evaluated the prototype in various cross axis motions. A clockwise and counterclockwise motion pattern used on the user’s finger is shown in Figure 4 (b). We observed minor"

Our prototype was placed upside down (i.e. ball bearings facing down and hidden from the participant’s sight) on a stand in front of the participants. Participants were asked to place their elbow on an arm rest (to avoid the gorilla arm effect) and grab the device with the index finger at the bottom and thumb on top similar to holding their smart phone (see figure 6). We asked them to slightly adjust the positioning of the prototype so that the index finger would be placed at a known position and orientation with respect to frame of reference of the prototype. The participant could see neither the motion nor the size of the ball bearing. The goal is to evaluate participants’ ability to recognize various factors composing haptic stimuli located on the peripheral parts of their fingertip pulp. In addition, we also gathered qualitative data to describe how the stimuli were perceived."

We used a ball bearing with a diameter corresponding to 65% of the elevation of the finger1 (rounded to the closest integer in millimeters). This part was composed of 20 stimuli varying 2 factors. The first factor was the Angle between the axis of the finger and the general direction of the motion centered in the middle of the first phalanx, which describes the location at which the ball bearing was touching the finger. Angle varied from −90° to 90° with a 20° increment (10 different angles in total). The second factor was Type which describes 2 different types of sharpness: Poke where the ball bearing performed a single contact with the finger lasting 100ms; and Vibration where the ball bearing performed a vibration composed of 5 localized back and forth roll in contact with the finger. The poking force depended on the skin stiffness of the users. However the prototype could exert a maximum 0.1N force. Similarly, the stage vibrated by 3mm but the actual vibration in contact with the skin depended on the skin friction of the users. After each stimuli and using a custom made application (see figure 6), we asked participants to place markers on a virtual finger in order to record: the location and the surface covered on which they felt the stimuli. We also asked them to rate on a 5-points Likert scale How strong was the stimulus (from very weak to very strong) and How comfortable was the stimulus (from very uncomfortable to very comfortable). The second part aimed at assessing participants’ ability to recognize patterns. This part was composed of 20 stimuli varying 3 factors. The first factor was the Pattern which describes the motion followed by the ball bearing along the finger. The different Patterns were (figure 5): rolling from the left part of the pulp to the right part of the pulp in a Clockwise motion, its Counter-Clockwise counter-part, rolling up and down on the Left or Right part of the pulp, and rolling left and right on the Top part of the pulp. The second factor was Speed which describes the speed at which the ball bearing was rolling on the surface. It has 2 different values2: Slow (11mm.s−1) and Fast (21mm.s−1). The third 165% of the elevation corresponds approximately to the height at which the finger is the widest. 2We chose the speeds in function of our device mechanical constraints, but also to ensure that the marbles would not fall due to sudden accelerations."

      "text": "With the Pulp Friction study we aimed at exploring the use of the finger pad periphery for haptic feedback. Using the periphery of the finger has the advantage of expanding the realm of haptic feedback as it is not concurrent with existing feedback which are applied to finger pad or palm. We argue that one could still use the phone vibration mode alongside our marble multiplying the possibilities. Our objective was to layout the different dimensions that could be leveraged for a new haptic notification system, as well as proceeding in an initial test of these different dimensions. We compile our findings into a set of initial guidelines. Angle and sharpness. Figure 8 shows the distinct zones of the GuessedAngle variable that the participants perceived for poke, vibration and combined poke and vibration modes. For reliable haptic feedback, the designers could choose non-consecutive zones. For example, -90° to -70°, - 30° to -10°, 10° to 30° and 50° to 90° for vibration could be selected. When using a discrete poking stimuli, up to five different angles, e.g. -90°, -30°, 0°, 30° and 90° can be chosen spread around the finger. This number drops to four, e.g. -90°, -30°, 30° and 90° when using a discrete vibrating stimuli. This result correlates the fact that vibration feels more spread than poking. Looking at the analysis of the Surface variable, we are not able to characterize the haptic resolution of the periphery. However when looking at the figure 9, especially the vibration data, one could hypothesize that away from the finger tip, haptic resolution is less. More studies should be carried out to either infirm or confirm this hypothesis. Patterns. According to the analysis of the Pattern recognition alongside participants comments, designers can accurately rely on our five proposed patterns as well as orientation versions of the Left,Right andTop Patterns.When observing the participants, we noticed that the lack of attention after a certain number of trials, as well as a confusion due to their mental representation of the Clockwise and CounterClockwise Patterns can partly explain not achieving a 100% recognition score. If we assume that certain participants were confused between Clockwise and CounterClockwise, the recognition rate for both increased to 98.4%, and the overall rate to 95.9%. Size. The average ErrorSize found was 2.1mm with a standard deviation of 1.4mm. Designers can therefore consider that users are able to differentiate sizes that are more than 5mm of diameter apart. Speed. Our findings on Speed did not show any abilities in differentiating our 2 speeds. Our speeds revealed to be too close, but further testing needs to be done. We hypothesis that speeds more than 10mm.s−1 apart could be differentiated."

      "text": "We envision the use of the finger pad periphery as a new haptic notification system. In the following, we present several use cases in which such a system could be used. All of these use cases were also mentioned by our participants during the debriefing. Discrete notifications. With current implementations, devices deliver notification from different applications at the same level. Whether a smartphone receives a notification for an email, a text message or a news application, the whole device vibrates. In order to disambiguate the stimuli, users are required to pull their phone out of their pocket and visually check the type of the notification. Using our haptic notification system, when feeling a vibration, users can discretely filter notifications by simply sensing the marble from their pocket. Using strong magnets and small marbles such in-pocket notification could be implemented. One participant referred to it as an alternative to phone notifications which would convey more information discretely and without looking. Eye-free compass.When discovering a new city, applications such as Google map are often used to navigate from current location to a point of interests (e.g. conference centre, train station, etc.). After having set the destination, users are required to switch their focus from their surroundings to their phone in order to orientate themselves. In order to keep their visual focus on their surroundings, our haptic notification system could act as a compass. While keeping their phone in their pockets, the marble could vibrate left, front or right to indicate which way to go at a crossing. Again strong magnets and small marbles could be used for this in-pocket implementation. One participant particularly stressed that such a system would be eye-free and in your pocket, keeping the user aware and preventing phone-snatching. Another participant even envisioned this compass system useful for navigating in games with open-worlds."

Similarly, using the peripheral haptic channel could help conveying information or awareness on the current state of the device to visually impaired users. However it would not consume screen space. For instance, a gentle left roll on the finger could indicate a spelling mistake in the current message and a right roll could indicate that the message cannot be sent because of network issues."

In order for such a system to be viable, the hardware could be improved to include a docking mechanism at the edge of the device that would store marbles of different sizes. Going even further, since we rely on the use of magnets, one could envision to expand the area of operation reachable by the marbles to other faces of the device. The footprint of the current mechanism could be reduced and integrated into a mobile device by using smaller stepper motors and deploying them at the edges away from the hand grip. This would allow storing the marble at the edge of a device. A different drive mechanism with a matrix of planar electromagnetic coils could reduce the profile further [29]."

The vibration could be further reduced by mounting the actuators with adequate damping. The linear actuators also created audible noise. The participants used a headphone with white noise audio during the study. In a practical implementation of the technique, a silent operation of the marble is desired. The current prototype was built to evaluate the haptic feedback technique. It imposes several limitations which need to be addressed before it could be deployed on a handheld device. One requirement is to hold the existing devices with minimally altering our grip. The size of the prototype could be reduced using smaller and thinner actuators. Individual mini motors could consume between 0.3–2.7 W power. Smooth trajectories for the patterns and efficient transmission of motion from the motors to the magnetic stage is required for low-power operation. In this way compact driver circuits could be developed due to low heat generation. Subtle input using the marble could also be implemented by placing a 2-axis magnetic sensor with flexible wiring on top of the disc magnets [30]."
