So you mentioned the implementations of the coil design itself, but I don't really remember the number of loops in coil design would sort of have different effect on this trend.

And yeah, second question that I have on when you mentioned the error, what was exactly it has? Like what error was actually measured? - Which value, the tracking evaluation? - [Audience Member] Yeah, the tracking evaluation, with your duo magnetic accuracies, and seeing the accuracy sort of improve. How did you measure it? - Yeah, so that was simply accumulated average error between the ground truth, which is the Optitrack position of the magnet, versus what we have basically with-- - [Audience Member] Okay, oh so the Optitrack tracks them so they're working just like that.
