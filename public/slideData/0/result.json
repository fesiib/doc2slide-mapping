Thank you so much, thank you. (audience clapping) - Wonderful, thank you, Maria. And we'd like to invite any questions, so if you do have a question, please raise your hand clearly. And there's a few at the front here. - You look like my coauthor, Fannie, so I was like, \"Fannie's gonna ask a question?\" But you're not, okay. - No. But I do have a question really quickly, obvious one, in and out. What do you think about this result of role-modeling actually having a negative influence? Is there something in the literature suggesting that that would happen? Because anecdotally from personal experience, I think we often find that valuable. - So actually, in mentoring literature, role-modeling is considered one of the functions of mentoring. However, I don't think, because it is very contextual to the mentor, people do not, most likely, when they see this kind of information, they just waive it. So this is why we have no significant effect with the original requester, or when third parties read these, more likely they are thinking, \"This is irrelevant, \"this is not something that we would actually appreciate,\" so instead, they would prefer to see actual steps. That's my feeling. Yeah. Is there any other question that I can answer? - [Announcer] We have time for one other question, otherwise, I can ask one. So I'd really like to ask, in your paper, you talked about the difference between online support and off-line support, and also automated support could be a future direction, what are the kind of challenges in providing automated mentoring and other places where that would be appropriate and inappropriate? - Okay, that's a very interesting question. So I think one of the challenges is how we can integrate the relational component of mentoring, and I had a little bit of that in my slides, but because I'm out of time. So most of the time, like in the case of health online communities, you see extended relationships, wherein career mentoring, people just go, they're ad hoc interactions. They go, they post their question, they get the response, they leave, so, one, I think, of the challenges is how we can have extended relationships online that they can actually help the people throughout their careers, especially, for people who do not have access to mentors, and believe me, there are many out there. So I think that can be a way that automation can actually help people, as mechanics of the extending part of the relationship. - [Announcer] Wonderful, please join me in thanking Maria. - Thank you so much, thank you.
