My name is Zhang Qiang from the office in Germany. And regarding the realistic use during biking, have you also considered if accidental clenching might have been, for instance, when you're quite exhausted, and just squeeze your jaws. - That's a really good question. We did not explore intent to interact, which you might think about, there's lots of reasons why you might clench that are not accidental as well, right? And so being able to distinguish when somebody intends that and when they don't is always an interesting challenge. Not something we looked at in depth. It would be interesting to see if you could develop a sense of force profile, so what should be ignored, for example, or whether there's a way that you'd want to indicate start of interaction. - [Zhang] Okay, thanks. - [Audience Member] That was a really nice talk, thanks. I was just wondering about the mapping function between the actual clench forces and the levels, because the levels themselves were evenly spaced, whereas I would imagine, and I could be wrong, that the force exerted wouldn't necessarily be linearly actuated. - Yeah. - [Audience Member] And then the second question was for something that would be, what about individual differences? Did you notice the need for-- - Could you speak up on the second question? - [Audience Member] Did you notice the need for individual differences, to calibrate for individual differences, in order to achieve accuracy? - Right, so we did do some calibration in order to determine what was the minimum and maximum force that we wanted to map the range into. I don't believe that we also used a variable force profile in doing that mapping. And unfortunately, Orson really should be here to answer your question about to what degree we did individual calibration in the study. I don't believe we calibrated separately for each person. I think we were able to determine a reasonable choice that worked for everyone, but I would have to refer back to him to be positive about that. - [Audience Member] Okay, thank you very much. - Yeah.
