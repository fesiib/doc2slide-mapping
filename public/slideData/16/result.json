In our paper you can find receipt data from both participant groups that suggest that users in the Shipt group bought a higher percentage of healthy items even though many of them reported their shopping habits remained more or less the same. Precisely what it means to eat healthy can be largely cultural. According to James in 2004, folks with African American descent may view eating healthy as giving up on their cultural heritage and conforming to the dominant culture. Plus in HCI research from Parker and Grenter in 2014 shows that health systems ought to consider the value of collectivism that is deeply embedded within the African American community. We find in HCI an appropriate space to build on this population's sense of community while engendering positive health behaviors but only with accounts for the nuanced traditions their norms of communication, and ancestral beliefs in consuming of food for soulful nourishment. Soul food after all is extremely delicious, and consists of dishes like macaroni and cheese, fried chicken, and collard greens that we love in the United States but know are high in fat and calories. We therefore suggest the option for online services to promote healthy recipes and selection behaviors that are based not only on the individual's past purchases but those of their community.

And lastly we would like to thank the National Science Foundation for their funding support as well Jacob Berman, The Social Innovations Group, and Michigan Interactive and Social Computing for their feedback. Thank you and I'm happy to take your questions. (crowd applauds) - [Announcer] For questions please use the microphones at the next to the doors. Or raise your hand if you can't get to the microphone. - [Andy] My name's Andy Warren from Uber. One of the products I actually work on is UberEats and when we're actually studying grocery delivery, food delivery a lot there's an interesting dynamic when you have a multi-sided marketplace. And I was wondering, and when I say multi-sided marketplace I mean you have the consumer who is getting delivery but then also the food vendors who are providing that, the shoppers who might be shopping for it, and then also the people who might be doing the delivery. I was wondering how did this come into account with the study that you were conducting here? - You wanna take that? - Thank you, it's Andy? Thanks Andy for your question. So I'm gonna repeat for live stream. So you're asking about the additional stakeholders that are involved in this process how do they come into place. So we do acknowledge a limitation in our study that the shopper is one stakeholder that we were unable to interact with and we believe it might be interesting to explore how these shoppers are being rated, these are their jobs. But I think the implication for the stores is a sense of loyalty which Sylvia mentioned in her segment of the presentation because a lot of people are loyal to certain stores and if these stores aren't participating then it's hard for them to maintain that loyalty. So I guess from an UberEats perspective I'm not quite sure how these third party, how they're involved, right? How do they sign up? Or how do they engage? But at least for our populations I would encourage you all if you have the ability to go to these local vendors and see if they would be interested in participating. Because we did, that sense of loyalty did show up. And there was one more stakeholder so that yeah our study looked at the shoppers themselves right. So what you hear in this presentation is that perspective. - [Dane] Hey Dane Cosley, Cornell. So I'm trying to think about how much of the benefit from the point of view of the participants was about positive health behaviors and healthy eating. And how much of it was sort of about convenience and experience right? Because in the what you presented a lot of it was more about the experience than the healthy eating and so I was just wondering if you could talk a little more about any parts that were about the healthiness, I mean obviously access to better food than is available locally, that's the dimension of healthy but do they talk about other parts of it? - Yes, so in our paper when we further explore the second research question, the aspect of impulse buying came into effect especially when purchasing in brick and mortar stores. We had one participant who said that the experience of shopping online actually limited those impulse buying habits which enabled her to purchase healthier food items as opposed to being at a checkout line, we are prone to being more distracted. So yes we did have some evidence of that in our paper. - [Dane] Okay - Thank you. - I'm sorry, did you have any more about, how many of the people were in caregiving relationships?
