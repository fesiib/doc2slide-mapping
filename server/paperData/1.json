    "text": "ABSTRACT Although people frequently seek mentoring or advice for their career, most mentoring is performed in person. Little research has examined the nature and quality of career mentoring online. To address this gap, we study how people use online Q&A forums for career advice. We develop a taxonomy of career advice requests based on a qualitative analysis of posts in a career-related online forum, identifying three key types: best practices, career threats, and time-sensitive requests. Our quantitative analysis of responses shows that both requesters and external viewers value general information, encouragement, and guidance, but not role modeling. We found no relation between the type of requests and features of responses, nor differences in responses valued by requesters versus external viewers. We present design recommendations for supporting online career advice exchange."

      "text": "Managing career development is a major challenge for the working population [10]. Careers have become boundaryless [37], evolving across many different fields [21]. Career mentoring, traditionally conducted in-person, is now widely accessible online to help people navigate these changes. Career mentoring is the relationship between a protégé and a mentor i.e., someone more experienced within or outside an organization who supports the personal and professional growth of the protégé [14]. Seeking and sustaining career mentoring through in-person interactions contributes to learning and career growth [36]. Resources that support \"offline mentorship\" range from traditional mentoring to mentoring between peers at work [35], to career-focused social networks (i.e., distributed mentoring from different social sources such as peers, friends, and family [27]), to career professionals such as executive coaches [17] and formal mentoring programs."

      "text": "Despite the benefits of career mentoring [36], many working adults lack access to in-person mentors. For instance, underrepresented groups within a profession have limited career-focused or developmental social networks [29]. Moreover, most of theworking population cannot afford expensive career professionals [5, 22]. Offline career mentoring relationships can also be dysfunctional. People may experience sabotage, envy, harassment or bullying from mentors, which can hamper career success [13, 49, 51]. Online career mentoring offers a unique opportunity to remove some of the burdens and costs of traditional mentoring. In particular, online Q&A forums support a rich variety of knowledge exchange [24, 39, 56], but prior work has not yet examined whether and how these forums support career advice seeking or mentoring functions. For instance, interactions in these forums may be useful for exchanging information, but they tend to be ad hoc, i.e., they lack a previous history of interaction. Thus, they may fail to support the relational aspect of offline mentoring. Nonetheless, understanding these ad hoc dynamics are especially important as new digitally enabled forms of mentoring emerge (e.g., virtual coaches, online communities, and distributed mentoring) [23, 54] that people may rely on for career advice and support."

We examine the ad hoc dynamics of seeking and receiving career advice. We leverage online community interactions to identify the types of career challenges people face today. We also compare the functions of offline and online mentoring (social support, informational, and role modeling; [11, 35]) and provide implications for what people value as career advice. We differentiate those who seek career advice online into two types: 1) the original requesters who experience a challenge and seek advice through a post, and 2) the third party (external) viewers who may face similar experiences or are interested in learning, i.e., anyone who will search for similar questions online. Our study focuses on three research questions:"

One direction of work examines the role of technological interventions in disadvantaged and low resourced workforce [25, 57]. For example, Dillahunt et al. explored how job seekers from low socioeconomic status leverage technology to find jobs [12]. Another direction investigates career skills development, identifying how digital technologies promote learning and communication through online communities [16, 34] and recommendation systems, e.g., Crowd Coach, which facilitates peer coaching while people work [9]. Similarly, research on e-mentoring (mentoring via electronic communications for education purposes [53]) considers interactions organized around professional activities [6, 7]. For example, MentorNet is a structured e-mentoring program that pairs female college students with professionals in engineering and science [32]. Our research contributes to this field by examining the type and value of career advice people seek and receive online."

      "text": "Career mentoring can come from not only a dedicated mentor, but also professional coaches, peers, friends, and family. Mentoring sources can be formal through assigned or professional mentors or mentoring programs, which is known to have limited impact, or informal through relationships and interactions external to an organization [8]. Mentoring sources can be viewed as a developmental network, i.e., a group of people with an active interest in and action toward advancing one’s career. Career progress is associated with having a series of mentoring relationships or a configuration of mentors over the course of one’s career [27]. E-mentoring is a mentoring source less related to organizational context that can increase mentorship access and provide similar support as offline mentoring [43, 52]. Studies within health and education online communities suggest that e-mentoring can contribute to users’ well-being, learning, and skill acquisition through the feedback and support received [7, 56]. Similar to e-mentoring, career mentoring in online communities may promote users’ careers through support from users with similar experiences, experts, or the crowd in general. However, both offline mentoring and e-mentoring tend to be dyadic and part of ongoing relationships developed within private channels, while career mentoring in online communities enables people to post publicly to a large audience of potential mentors. In our research, we focus on a widely-used source of online career mentoring: Q&A forums."

Q&A forums are online communities for sharing expertise, where individuals can pose questions and receivemultiple responses from a broad set of individuals [2]. In Q&A forums, the advice seeker may have little previous mentorship interactions. Prior work has examined the content and dynamics of these systems, such as on Yahoo Answers [2], Quora [47, 55], and StackOverflow [39], but has yet to explore the nature of the career mentoring interactions in such environments. Q&A forum interactions differ in nature and structure from offline mentorship. In Q&A forums, questions are public to a relatively unknown and often anonymous audience of many potential respondents [24]. Questions on Q&A forums such as StackOverflow can also receive responses very quickly, often within 12 minutes [39]. These forums rely on a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to participate, including through visible reputation markers and connections to one’s interests and identities [28]. Responses to questions can benefit the person who originally asked the question as well as the third-party observers. Posted questions can be conversational, discursive, or informational [24]. Question types include: factual (seeking objective data), advice (seeking recommendations), opinion (seeking others’ viewpoints), and non-questions (spam) [28, 39, 44]. While"

For example, people may receive confirmation and acceptance, a form of socio-emotional support, from strangers who cannot directly affect their current employment conditions [31]. People may also seek informational support through coaching online, in order to overcome challenges while managing exposure and protecting their careers. At the same time, given the population of strangers, some support may be limited, such as instrumental support through sponsorship. Although people seek career advice in online Q&A forums, it is unclear whether and how interactions in these forums will support key functions of mentorship observed in offline and online dyadic mentoring [35, 43, 51].

For example, the original requester may appreciate and be more likely to upvote a response that offers advice tailored to a personal situation. Third parties later reading may find general best practices and relevant knowledge more valuable than context-specific advice. Requesters may also appreciate socio-emotional aspects of the advice, such as encouraging language and affirmation similar to traditional mentoring [27, 35].

In terms of anonymity, 534 unique users of these posts were anonymous (89.9%), 20 users revealed their name in the url but have a nickname on StackExchange (3.4%), and 40 have both their names and reveal their names on url (6.7%). The average number of responses for the posts in our dataset was 3.14. 304 original posts had an accepted response, 182 out of which had at least one more (rejected) response."

The follow-ups consisted of the following types of behavior: acknowledgments of the responses such as thanks and gratitude expressions (29% of posts), clarifications of the original post/question (21% of posts), asking additional questions (8.5% of posts), and \"other or irrelevant\" posts (14.5% of posts). Consistent with previous findings [48], these indicate that users view the online community as a mentoring platform, with a \"mentoring value\" ranging from a simple \"thank you\" to asking more questions."

Following previous guidelines [30, 42], a single researcher (first author) conducted all of the coding. She coded posts using an inductive process where major themes emerge through interpretation of the data [46]. This process allows the researcher to continually create and refine categories to develop a complete or saturated categorization of the data [20]. The process was to (1) review the collected data and identify preliminary themes and categories, (2) revise these categories based on their relevance to subsequent new data as collected, and (3) create typologies for main themes and categories. First-order coding categorized the naturally occurring themes in the data. We used NVivo to calculate the frequency of the codes (i.e., the number of times a code was mentioned within and across the posts, [38]).

Intra-class correlations (ICCs) with one-way random effects ranged from .81 to .84, indicating that most of the variance in MTurker judgments could be attributed to the post being evaluated.

We used logistic regression with response nested within request, to examine whether functions of a response predicted the likelihood of the original requester accepting the response. Responses containing more guidance were more likely to be accepted (β = 4.13, t = 2.82, p = .005), while other request features were not significantly related to acceptance (see Table 3). In a follow-up analysis not reported in Table 3, we included interactions between request type and response functions, but found no significant interactions (p = ns). This suggests that guidance is valued by the original requester across request types. Next, we used linear regression with response nested within request to assess how fuctions of responses were associated with the value of a post as rated by MTurkers. Functions of responses explained 65% of the variance in MTurks’ judgments of response value. Responses with more general information (β = .41, t = 3.74,p = .001), encouragement (β = .23, t = 2.54,p = .011) and guidance (β = .73, t = 7.21,p = .001) were rated as more valuable. In contrast, responses with more role modeling were judged less valuable, although the effect was only marginally significant (β = −.10, t = −1.87,p = .06). When we probed for interactions between request type and response function on external perceived value of the response, we found no significant results (p = ns).

The associations were weaker for the requesters’ value judgments because regression analyses lose power with binary outcomes [50].

We did so by developing a new scale that allows us to assess online career mentoring functions. Analyses revealed four types of online career advice (general information provision, role modeling, guidance, and encouragement) that were similar to but not identical with functions ofmentoring in offline environments. For example, online encouragement contains only one element of the socio-emotional support seen offline. Similarly, offline role modeling often occurs by observing what a mentor does, but our results show that online role modeling relies on explicit statements made by the mentor. Surprisingly, we found no relationships between the taxonomy of online career advice questions and the functions of responses they elicited. One might have expected that best practice requests will elicit general information responses and threat requests will elicit encouragement, but our data did not reveal such relationships. Additionally, while onemight have expected that the requesters and observers would value different types of responses (e.g., requesters seek personalized guidance, while external observers might want general information), results show that the same functions of responses predicted both requesters’ and observers’ perceptions of value."
