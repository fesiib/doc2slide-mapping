We argue, however, that people should be given more opportunities to articulate the kind of technology-mediated world they want to be living in.

(audience applauding) Any questions? - [Moderator] The floor is open for any questions you might have. I do have a question myself, if you don't mind. So when it comes to, in your opinion, what's the core factor that comes out of drama and deliberation? The core contribution. - Um, so. Well, I think, now, in the paper, we also describe the different stages. We use drama in different ways, both to insonate these prototypes and dramatize a little bit what they are doing, and in the policy, and I think Kruakae talked a lot about that in the presentation, the role of that in policy research for people to embody, embody the scenarios that, and really remembering how they felt about a particular technology, a particular context, because they can theorize that, but when you put yourself in the shoes of, that situation's quite different. So I think that is the conditions. - So if I understand your question correctly, you asked cost factor, right? - [Moderator] Core contribution. - Oh, core contribution. Well, um, I think it goes to also acceptance. It's building onto what other factors that would allow people to embrace something new, and this, by learning in greater details about what people actually want, you standing a better chance of delivering what meets the demands. - [Moderator] Thank you. - There's a question there. - [Audience Member] Yeah, hi, thank you, Rachel Jones. I'm very interested in this, I'm working in this area, so it's really interesting. Now, you used as your object the hair dryer, as such, and I wondered, although that created the conversation, in a way, and helped the drama, which was in a way the intervention, I wondered if you'd chosen a different object if you'd created a slightly different conversation. Because the hair dryer feels very personal. So could you say why that object was chosen and how you could abstract, say, from that object to other objects? - Yeah, I think the aim of the project was, well, the project was sponsored by the EU Policy Lab, and the aim was really to provoke some discussion. So we really wanted to get into the personal level and have some object that people relate to, but it has this feeling of a little bit strange, it's not really a kettle that has been used so many times, but it's also not a battery that is anonymous and it's in your house, as there are many applications nowadays. So the hair dryer was really, we wanted something that is slightly provocative and strange, yes. - You also created the kettle. - Yes, well, this is also a series of projects that's part of a bigger project called Autonomous Energy Systems, so there are some other objects that I can advertise now that we are developing right now, which is a kettle that is less focused on the speculative side of that and more focused about how people would live within autonomous systems that, with an autonomous system that would do these transactions in the home, but then we chose a kettle because the kettle is less strange and is less provocative, somehow, so people would adopt that and would use it, yes. - And so we tested, to answer your question, we tested the kettle in a slightly different context. We didn't use drama, but we used the concept of drama in terms of organizing people's experience. And kettle created a different type of conversation, possibly because of the cultural effect. So when it comes to people not being able to boil the kettle in order, and then therefore can't make tea, in the English context, that's a big deal. (laughing) - Yes, but these objects are really like research artifacts that can have different behaviors, yeah. And yeah, the hair dryers had this particular characteristic. - [Audience Member] I was wondering, too, with the choice of drama, thinking, I've read a bit about design fiction and other kind of forms of helping people imagine. So could you talk a bit about what led you to focus on drama specifically, or other kind of ways of helping people imagine different future that you'd consider? - Yeah, there is plenty of research in ACI and people who presented here at CHI, and I'm seeing some faces, who worked with drama before in amazing ways. We tried to reference all of them in the paper, I hope we did cover. But in our case, drama was more, well, again, we used drama in two different ways. But I think it's brilliant to either get people to perform and try to put themselves in the situations or to give them more experiential scenario of designs that might be critical, yes. - So also the drama aspect, in connection with design, we also wanted to dramatize the issues that, or what would be a little bit problematic, what we hope people would find problematic, and act that out. - Yeah, and I must say that we left the actors to just do their job, and they were absolutely brilliant. They got it without, and they raised issues that we didn't think before. So for us, it was absolutely brilliant to work with them. Yeah, they're very creative and imaginative, and yeah. - So in this way, drama actually frames, or as a question, or a pitch, a problem, for people to consider it, rather than telling them that this is what we assume to be a problem for you. - [Moderator] Thank you, and this concludes our session for today.
