Well, drama is frequently used in design, but not as often used in policy-making. The common ambition in design and public policies is public support. Often in both design and public policy, getting public support goes so far as product testing and political polls. We argue, however, that people should be given more opportunities to articulate the kind of technology-mediated world they want to be living in.

(audience applauding) Any questions? - [Moderator] The floor is open for any questions you might have. I do have a question myself, if you don't mind. So when it comes to, in your opinion, what's the core factor that comes out of drama and deliberation? The core contribution. - Um, so. Well, I think, now, in the paper, we also describe the different stages. We use drama in different ways, both to insonate these prototypes and dramatize a little bit what they are doing, and in the policy, and I think Kruakae talked a lot about that in the presentation, the role of that in policy research for people to embody, embody the scenarios that, and really remembering how they felt about a particular technology, a particular context, because they can theorize that, but when you put yourself in the shoes of, that situation's quite different. So I think that is the conditions. - So if I understand your question correctly, you asked cost factor, right? - [Moderator] Core contribution. - Oh, core contribution. Well, um, I think it goes to also acceptance. It's building onto what other factors that would allow people to embrace something new, and this, by learning in greater details about what people actually want, you standing a better chance of delivering what meets the demands. - [Moderator] Thank you. - There's a question there. - [Audience Member] Yeah, hi, thank you, Rachel Jones. I'm very interested in this, I'm working in this area, so it's really interesting. Now, you used as your object the hair dryer, as such, and I wondered, although that created the conversation, in a way, and helped the drama, which was in a way the intervention, I wondered if you'd chosen a different object if you'd created a slightly different conversation. Because the hair dryer feels very personal. So could you say why that object was chosen and how you could abstract, say, from that object to other objects? - Yeah, I think the aim of the project was, well, the project was sponsored by the EU Policy Lab, and the aim was really to provoke some discussion. So we really wanted to get into the personal level and have some object that people relate to, but it has this feeling of a little bit strange, it's not really a kettle that has been used so many times, but it's also not a battery that is anonymous and it's in your house, as there are many applications nowadays. So the hair dryer was really, we wanted something that is slightly provocative and strange, yes. - You also created the kettle. - Yes, well, this is also a series of projects that's part of a bigger project called Autonomous Energy Systems, so there are some other objects that I can advertise now that we are developing right now, which is a kettle that is less focused on the speculative side of that and more focused about how people would live within autonomous systems that, with an autonomous system that would do these transactions in the home, but then we chose a kettle because the kettle is less strange and is less provocative, somehow, so people would adopt that and would use it, yes. - And so we tested, to answer your question, we tested the kettle in a slightly different context. We didn't use drama, but we used the concept of drama in terms of organizing people's experience. And kettle created a different type of conversation, possibly because of the cultural effect. So when it comes to people not being able to boil the kettle in order, and then therefore can't make tea, in the English context, that's a big deal. (laughing) - Yes, but these objects are really like research artifacts that can have different behaviors, yeah. And yeah, the hair dryers had this particular characteristic. - [Audience Member] I was wondering, too, with the choice of drama, thinking, I've read a bit about design fiction and other kind of forms of helping people imagine. So could you talk a bit about what led you to focus on drama specifically, or other kind of ways of helping people imagine different future that you'd consider? - Yeah, there is plenty of research in ACI and people who presented here at CHI, and I'm seeing some faces, who worked with drama before in amazing ways. We tried to reference all of them in the paper, I hope we did cover. But in our case, drama was more, well, again, we used drama in two different ways. But I think it's brilliant to either get people to perform and try to put themselves in the situations or to give them more experiential scenario of designs that might be critical, yes. - So also the drama aspect, in connection with design, we also wanted to dramatize the issues that, or what would be a little bit problematic, what we hope people would find problematic, and act that out. - Yeah, and I must say that we left the actors to just do their job, and they were absolutely brilliant. They got it without, and they raised issues that we didn't think before. So for us, it was absolutely brilliant to work with them. Yeah, they're very creative and imaginative, and yeah. - So in this way, drama actually frames, or as a question, or a pitch, a problem, for people to consider it, rather than telling them that this is what we assume to be a problem for you. - [Moderator] Thank you, and this concludes our session for today. You've all been brilliant.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 31, "startTime": 1449.33, "endTime": 1453.33, "script": "(audience applauding)", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 32, "startTime": 1453.33, "endTime": 1466.0, "script": "The SEC staff as well, and also the student volunteers.

enterprises.", " This mode of energy supply relies on data management and processing, and fast and secure transactions.", " Blockchain technologies are often seen as the optimal infrastructure to enable such transactions [1], as their record structure is continuously encrypted, distributed and synchronized across multiple geographic sites, which guarantees data immutability.", " Most

below the display to buy (pull) and sell (push) energy.", " The device can be activated through a third \u201con\u201d button.", " In our speculative scenario, GigBliss Plus would be acquired at a high price but would allow end-users to make a profit, which could also cover the initial outlay.", " The scenario alludes to a tendency of recent systems to support flexible and ad-hoc forms of employment where workers use their own tools.", " This form of work contrasts to \u201ctraditional\u201d forms of work as it includes no security and little guarantee of long-term contracts.", " In our critical scenario, individuals would use their hairdryers and potentially other appliances to store energy and make money, e.g., possibly from carrying out other services such as riding in their Uber taxis and renting out spare bedrooms through Airbnb.", " This device was the first concept developed and its name is an allusion to the gig economy.", " GigBliss Balance.", " The second model

are dramatically reduced to end-users and profit and potential losses from energy transactions are returned to the GigBliss Corporation.", " GigBliss Auto.", " The third concept, GigBliss Auto, represents a model where a third party would subsidise costs of both devices and electricity supply for the device for a particular group.", " In this context, a local Council, community service, or charity establishes an agreement with an energy provider and the hairdryer company, paying a fixed price and setting up conditions for energy access.", " Here we invite reflection on the interests of stakeholders and what happens if this agreement attempts to reduce costs in order to maximise the number of households served by this scheme or if, for example, energy provision is set to occur during

Design Fictions have been extensively employed in HCI as a way to reflect on future technologies or critique current practice.", " According to Auger [3] a key aspect of Speculative Design is the construction of a \u2018perceptual bridge\u2019 by which designers engage their audiences, and which demands a careful management of the speculation.", " Critical Design was originally defined by

spaces are the classical venues for designers to exhibit and engage audiences with critical design pieces [22].", " Pieces in the gallery space are often meant to provoke an emotional response that would lead to further conversations beyond this context.", " The GigBliss hairdryers have been exhibited on two occasions.", " In our experience, the gallery space did not allow for an analysis of the impact of the designs or a more systematic conversation with participants.", " Furthermore, although the unfamiliar interface suggests some level of strangeness, in order to trigger discussion, the hairdryers require active interaction and some degree of contextualization.", " There has been much discussion in HCI about the value of Design Fictions or \u201cdiegetic\u201d prototypes that incorporate story worlds [43].", " While Bleecker [6] presents it as the creation of artefacts that foster imagination about possible near future worlds in order to tell stories that provoke reactions

larger audiences through popular media, where fictitious designs are often portrayed as real-world products.", " Ultimately the hairdryers were used in two ways 1) to support the performance of the sketches, with GigBliss Plus and Balance in operation, and GigBliss Auto turned off as explained below, and 2) to provide participants with some experience of the infrastructure behind the devices.", " While in current approaches the discussion seems to end in the ability to raise awareness and critique, our aim was to generate discussion and potentially reconcile the critique with the values and

The first part focused on producing three sketches to be used as vignettes to prompt reflective discussion.", " The second focused on involving participants in role-playing of different stakeholders, as a way to engage them in the deliberation process.", " In the first part the aim was to provoke an emotional response to critical issues in order to stir discussion.", " The three actors were

it isn\u2019t that bad and they just needed to imagine the energy company as a fourth flatmate.", " Sarah remarks that this would be a very wealthy flatmate, as this person would have preference in the hair drying queue.", " The interpretation of the actors helped to frame the designs as real world contexts while bringing forward issues of recent technologies, such as stock market operations,

stages.", " This is later developed into Speculative Enactments [23] where participants, either professional actors or the general public, help to co-construct the action around designs through a form of empirical inquiry.", " Our approach draws from this work, as it uses performance to bring forward aspects of novel technologies that go beyond device features.", " However, our focus is not on the design itself but on creating a bridge between the critique and the public.", " We used performance in two moments: a) first, we engaged professional actors in the co-creation of the critique.", " The enactment of different scenarios of usage resulted in sketches that were selected and used as vignettes to prompt deliberation, b) second, we used improvisation to engage participants in the deliberation process, by inviting them to perform aspects of the technology.", " We integrated this role-play exercise to give participants a taste of negotiation, creating an event that engages

excerpted in Section 4 are negotiation and an exploration of what participants find problematic and the strategies to deal with these problems.", " Both groups of participants moved away from initial negative reaction naturally and relatively quickly, drawing on their experience and interactions with present technologies, products and services.", " The discussions concentrated on particular aspects of their experience with technologies, involving questions about their levels of agency, control, the beneficiaries that are invisible to them, and the knock-on effects of these arrangements.", " Participants moved from a position of rejecting the designs to one of reflective and open discussions about the issues underpinning the speculative hairdryers.", " This demonstrates the success of the combination of design, drama and deliberation in engaging the public to explore possible consequences of the complex technologies involved in autonomous distributed energy systems.", " The contribution of drama to speculative design and public engagement is the narrative and enactment of human feelings towards aspects of these technologies.", " Such feelings serve to convey a sense of the problem without formally defining or framing the problem for participants, which is one of the factors undermining meaningful public engagement [33].", " The narrative and sensation conveyed by drama make the unfamiliar technologies and abstract concepts or issues underlying the deployment of these technologies relevant to people who are not experts in these areas.", " Deliberation exposed participants to the rational aspect and exchange of their empirical experience with technologies.", " This rational engagement led them to explore and define what they find problematic about ownership and control in relation to algorithmic capabilities (GigBliss Balance), gigeconomy (GigBliss Plus) and third-party beneficiaries (GigBliss Auto).", " The four-step process of deliberation in this research helped to engage people in problem definition, which serves the objective of critical design as defined by Dunne and Raby [20], as well as problem solving.", " However, unlike \u201caffirmative\u201d design [20], problem-solving in the deliberative process focuses more on how people think these problems are best addressed given their resources and capabilities rather than on industry or business solutions.", " The participants\u2019 exchange of ideas regarding what would work for them show that the solution brainstorming and resolution phases of deliberation can move the emotional", " reaction provoked by critical design towards a discussion of how to address what brought about these negative reactions in the first place.", " This result demonstrates that deliberation can support critical design to achieve its societal aim, empowering people to contribute toward features they anticipated.", " This is particularly important in the context of distributed energy systems that touch sensitive aspects of access to basic resources.", " Articulating the desired human experience with autonomous technologies The initial responses from participants were characterized by distrust due in part to the invisibility of the processing of information.", " Distrust also resulted from the perceived lack of human empathy in the automated decisions based on algorithmic data processing and/or profiling taking place quietly in the background.", " Participants appeared more receptive to digitally mediated relationships with service providers and third-party beneficiaries that have degrees of emotional intelligence.", " Analysis of the transcript of participant deliberation shows that control and ownership are interdependent and a running thread across all the discussions prompted by the dramatic sketches.", " The interdependency between control and ownership is most prominent in the discussion about algorithmic capabilities underpinning the dramatic sketch featuring GigBliss Balance.", " Here control manifests in forms of on-demand usage of the device and access to electricity.", " Participants are most anxious about having access to basic necessities such as electricity managed by technologies that operate quietly in the background and in ways that they cannot understand because if something goes wrong, they would not easily be able to fix it.", " Participants were most nervous about the absence of options to override automated decisions and, in line with previous research [2], they were more receptive to delegating control to technologies when they could negotiate the level of delegation.", " Participants were most satisfied with the level of control offered by GigBliss Plus, its included resources, access to resources and values.", " However, they were concerned that only economically affluent people would be able to afford the resources required to generate and trade electricity for profit, ultimately resulting in an unequal energy distribution and price manipulation.", " Such a situation would be the opposite of the ideals to expand opportunities for people to generate electricity and trade it for profit.", " Worse still, participants were concerned that this transaction model would reinforce the gap between the resource-rich and the resource-poor.", " In exploring approaches to address issues of a free market energy economy, most participants seemed keen on economic regulation.", " They were also concerned that people would constantly check when the best time to trade is, drawing a", " parallel between people\u2019s behaviour with their phones and social media.", " In this context, participants admitted that exercising self-control was not an easy task, which implies that people need help to disconnect.", " The absence of control over the subsidised device and access to energy featured in the GigBliss Auto generated the strongest negative emotional reaction.", " Participants were clear in their responses that they would not exchange control for access.", " Here, the desired control manifests in forms of transparency regarding the actual beneficiaries, ownership (e.g.", " those who are profiting from people\u2019s compromising of the convenience of on-demand access), clarity in terms of use and real choice.", " Participants drew a parallel between the model of access to electricity coded in GigBliss Auto and the tiered model of access to a gym.", " The similarity between the two models of regulation is the restriction of access.", " The difference, however, are that the hours during which access is allowed are not clearly detailed in the terms of use for GigBliss Auto and that opting out could result in no access to electricity at all.", " These differences triggered strong resistance.", " However, participants became more receptive to the idea of delegating control over access to third parties on the condition that the terms of access are clear and consistent and they could say \u2018no\u2019 to the terms of access that they did not want, or deemed unfair, without being excluded from the service.", " The aspects of delegated autonomy that participants found problematic and the propositions that reduced participants\u2019 aversion to various limits of their control implied that a technological design that rules out opportunities to negotiate is likely to face strong resistance.", " Participants\u2019 responses demonstrated that their ultimate concern is that any design and use of technology would leave them little room for negotiation to achieve an acceptable compromise.", " In exploring approaches to maintain or make available abilities to negotiate, take back control and meaningfully exercise such choices, participants ranked transparency of business purposes and technology as top priorities.", " Participants\u2019 responses also showed that they value the ability to opt in or out and choose from various models of access and service provision without being excluded or trapped in exploitative deals.", " That said, participants clearly stated that they did not want to be overwhelmed with information and choices to constantly process either.", " Aware of the limits of individual agency and autonomy, participants also considered governance mechanisms that could shape technology design and deployment that are consistent with their values for negotiation, choice, transparency and fair terms of use.", " Participants were open to both binding and non-binding governance mechanisms, whichever best minimised exploitation.", " Some of the mechanisms considered included standards, certification logos and product labelling", " that build consumer trust in the autonomous distributed technologies.", " Given the high level of agency observed in participants\u2019 articulation of values and preferences, governance mechanisms that empower participants to meaningfully exercise choice without resulting in information and conscious choice fatigue are likely to be favoured."], [" The flow of deliberation, the articulation and rationalisation of what participants found problematic and approaches to address these challenges, all highlight the potential for the combination of speculative design, drama and deliberation in engaging the public with critical issues.", " The match between the socio-economic issues explored by each hairdryer and the issues participants focused their attention on in subsequent deliberations demonstrated the potential for design and drama to prompt reflective responses.", " The parallel that participants drew, for example, between the stock exchange and the GigBliss Plus in terms of purpose of use or between dependence on smartphones and dependence that technologies that provide means of profit could cultivate, highlighted the potential of drama in connecting participants\u2019 experience with unfamiliar aspects of technologies.", " This experience sharing served as a departure point for participants to examine why they felt the way they did \u00e2\u0102\u015e reflecting on their experience.", " The four steps of deliberation helped guide participants\u2019 thinking about the sensational aspect of their experience with technology, moving them from a negative reaction toward collective problem-solving.", " The combination of speculative design, drama and deliberation offers an alternative to engage the public with complex technology development and relevant policies.", " The design-based dramatised deliberation provides insights into participants\u2019 values and preferences for autonomous distributed technologies.", " These insights contribute to design the societal and civic values that are often overwhelmed by economic values, underpinning the focus of affirmative design on market and innovation.", " These societal and civic values are deduced from participants\u2019 expressions of function, sensibility and rationality of human experience.", " The basis from which insights are drawn can be generalised because others who are exposed to a similar experience are likely able to relate to these insights.", " Given the potential of this method, we propose it as a contribution to the existing literature in HCI on distributed energy systems as well as to the ongoing debate on emerging technologies and their implications for society."]], "paperSentences": ["", "Design Informatics, and I'm here with my colleague, Kruakae Pothong, she's gonna magically appear in the middle of the presentation to pick up from the part that she contributed to the work, mostly contributed to the work. And Kruakae is from Science, Technology, Engineering, and Public Policy, University College, London. And we are here to present our work, which is really an attempt to combine our expertise in design and policy research to look for ways to discuss issues around autonomous systems with the public, particularly in the context of energy. ", "So I think we're all aware that digital platforms and products are gaining different levels of autonomy. Perhaps we are not really reaching the vision of fully distributed autonomous societies, but you might have, for instance, have had your identity checked on your way to this conference, to Glasgow, and this might have involved some level of computational decision-making regarding your ability to travel. ", "And we are also aware that autonomous systems are designed and as a result of human design they're also embedded with particular values. ", "So how can we guarantee that these values are in line with those of people who are affected by the decisions made by these systems? Discussing these issues with those affected, of course, is paramount, but I also think that this is particularly challenging, ", "and it's challenging for three main reasons. So first of all is the seamlessness of the technology that is designed to collect data and process data, but which make decisions in the background, and these decisions are rendered invisible. Second is the absence of a bridge between this emerging technology that is seen as unfamiliar and people's experience with technology in the everyday, which becomes habitual and also invisible. And finally, and perhaps most importantly, is the lack of a conceptual space for experience-sharing, reflecting, and collecting problem-solving and decision-making. ", "So we think the design can help. Well, I'm a designer, of course I think that. And why design can indeed help to hide those decisions sometimes, as you can have many examples of products that do that, there has been several examples of speculative design projects that surface contentious issues and even provide the bridge between emerging and familiar technology. It is, however, not quite clear how we designers can provide a reconciliation between the critique and the course of action for technology co-implementation. ", "So Kruakae and I have worked together to devise a method that would support this reconciliation, and this method includes speculative design, drama, and deliberation. ", "So we are particularly interested in energy, and more specifically, in new models of energy distribution which are supported by technology such as blockchains, smart contracts, and smart batteries. So one application of smart batteries is, for example, in vehicles to grid systems, where batteries transact energy directly with the grid. So this way, vehicles not only consume energy but also distribute it, becomes distributed of energies, ", "which is quite, we found fascinating. So we designed the GigBliss hair dryers, which aimed to demonstrate how devices with autonomous batteries could support different levels of control while also supporting different interests and values. So we designed them as a conversational tool. ", "So similar to vehicle to grid systems, the GigBliss hair dryers transact energy directly with the grid, and the transaction is defined ", "by smart contracts hosted in a blockchain, not like the blockchain that we saw in the previous presentation, but a blockchain like Etherium or Hyperledger. And the profit of our loss from these transactions are automatically sent to a digital wallet. But then I ask, \"What would change if the owner \"of this wallet changes?\" And this is what we wanted to demonstrate with the different hair dryers. ", "So if GigBliss Plus, the holder of this wallet is the user, so the user buys the hair dryer, perhaps at a higher price, and synchronizes their digital wallet with the hair dryer, which allows them to cover costs and collect profit from managed transactions. ", "In the GigBliss Balance, however, the GigBliss corporation holds the wallet, so the corporation would lend or perhaps make the hair dryer available to consumers at a very low price, while holding the profit, as always, the pressure to reduce losses in energy transactions. ", "So finally, with GigBliss Auto, both hair dryers and energies would be subsidized by a third party which would, for instance, pay an X amount to the GigBliss corporation to distribute the hair dryers and provide energy to a specific group. ", "So we invited three actors to consider scenarios as well as underlying implications of using the hair dryers. We filmed their improvisations, and then chose three of the most provocative sketches to use in our deliberation sessions, which Kruakae will present. But I will show you excerpts of these sketches right now, ", "- So how does design meet drama meet public policy? Well, drama is frequently used in design, but not as often used in policy-making. The common ambition in design and public policies is public support. Often in both design and public policy, getting public support goes so far as product testing and political polls. We argue, however, that people should be given more opportunities to articulate the kind of technology-mediated world they want to be living in. And in this way, help shape the development of technologies and relevant policies. But often, future is a stretch of people's imagination, so it's difficult for them to talk about. ", "For both design and public policy deliberation, drama makes relatable to personal experience what might otherwise be unimaginable. In this specific case, what might otherwise be, in this specific case, the dramatic sketch and the theater improvisation gives people the context of views situating the new technology in a more familiar reality of their day to day life, and this is an example of how we used that. ", "kind of set up a system where you could basically change the peak times and non-peak times, ", "the participants to play the role of different types of users, and from this experience, they started to think about different purpose of use for technologies and start to critique it. And this is just their warmup exercise. ", "Um, so, drama also provides a sketch of communicative protocol for deliberation, easing the challenge of breaking the first word. Deliberation is a talk-based process to reach mutually acceptable solutions to social problems through an exchange of and a reflection on stories, experiences, opinions, argumentation, and preservation. The value of deliberation is empathetic reasoning rather than partisan position-taking and an obsession with winning a debate. ", "So to design deliberation provides a protocol for communication that supports critical design to achieve its societal aim of empowering people to articulate their values and preferences for future technologies. ", "Given the objective of deliberation being collective problem-solving, we follow a four-step process. This includes story sharing, problem definition, solution brainstorming, and resolution. ", "- So in this video, you saw the flow of deliberation from experience sharing, in this case, ", "and then the beginning of the solution brainstorming. ", "hopefully I'll get to the next slide. ", "Ah, there you go. This is a more detailed snapshot of the deliberation. So here you see the repertoire of deliberation moving from rejection to working out why they rejected the design, and arriving at, so what would work? Note the reference to the evolution of the phone. The parallel that the participants drew between the phone and the future technology, in this case, GigaBliss Plus hair dryer, demonstrates the success of drama as a bridge between the familiar technology, the phone, and the unfamiliar future features of technologies. ", "So here on the slide, you see, the table summarizes the values deduced from various suggested solutions to what participants deemed problematic. These values highlight strong sense of agency. This gives us an insight into what people expect from autonomous technologies. ", "So far we've seen that speculative design, drama, and deliberation combined allows us to elicit people's values and preferences for autonomous distributed technologies. The articulated desired functionality, sensibility, and rationality of human experience with autonomous technologies contribute societal and civic values that are often overwhelmed by economic values underpinning the focus of affirmative design on market and innovation. ", "As they stand, these societal and civic values provide blueprints for public support. Given the appropriate level of advocacy, these values could shape policies' implementation strategies and design for autonomous technologies, making these technologies and their usage better serve public interest, and that's it. ", "Thank you very much. (audience applauding) Any questions? - [Moderator] The floor is open for any questions you might have. I do have a question myself, if you don't mind. So when it comes to, in your opinion, what's the core factor that comes out of drama and deliberation? The core contribution. - Um, so. Well, I think, now, in the paper, we also describe the different stages. We use drama in different ways, both to insonate these prototypes and dramatize a little bit what they are doing, and in the policy, and I think Kruakae talked a lot about that in the presentation, the role of that in policy research for people to embody, embody the scenarios that, and really remembering how they felt about a particular technology, a particular context, because they can theorize that, but when you put yourself in the shoes of, that situation's quite different. So I think that is the conditions. - So if I understand your question correctly, you asked cost factor, right? - [Moderator] Core contribution. - Oh, core contribution. Well, um, I think it goes to also acceptance. It's building onto what other factors that would allow people to embrace something new, and this, by learning in greater details about what people actually want, you standing a better chance of delivering what meets the demands. - [Moderator] Thank you. - There's a question there. - [Audience Member] Yeah, hi, thank you, Rachel Jones. I'm very interested in this, I'm working in this area, so it's really interesting. Now, you used as your object the hair dryer, as such, and I wondered, although that created the conversation, in a way, and helped the drama, which was in a way the intervention, I wondered if you'd chosen a different object if you'd created a slightly different conversation. Because the hair dryer feels very personal. So could you say why that object was chosen and how you could abstract, say, from that object to other objects? - Yeah, I think the aim of the project was, well, the project was sponsored by the EU Policy Lab, and the aim was really to provoke some discussion. So we really wanted to get into the personal level and have some object that people relate to, but it has this feeling of a little bit strange, it's not really a kettle that has been used so many times, but it's also not a battery that is anonymous and it's in your house, as there are many applications nowadays. So the hair dryer was really, we wanted something that is slightly provocative and strange, yes. - You also created the kettle. - Yes, well, this is also a series of projects that's part of a bigger project called Autonomous Energy Systems, so there are some other objects that I can advertise now that we are developing right now, which is a kettle that is less focused on the speculative side of that and more focused about how people would live within autonomous systems that, with an autonomous system that would do these transactions in the home, but then we chose a kettle because the kettle is less strange and is less provocative, somehow, so people would adopt that and would use it, yes. - And so we tested, to answer your question, we tested the kettle in a slightly different context. We didn't use drama, but we used the concept of drama in terms of organizing people's experience. And kettle created a different type of conversation, possibly because of the cultural effect. So when it comes to people not being able to boil the kettle in order, and then therefore can't make tea, in the English context, that's a big deal. (laughing) - Yes, but these objects are really like research artifacts that can have different behaviors, yeah. And yeah, the hair dryers had this particular characteristic. - [Audience Member] I was wondering, too, with the choice of drama, thinking, I've read a bit about design fiction and other kind of forms of helping people imagine. So could you talk a bit about what led you to focus on drama specifically, or other kind of ways of helping people imagine different future that you'd consider? - Yeah, there is plenty of research in ACI and people who presented here at CHI, and I'm seeing some faces, who worked with drama before in amazing ways. We tried to reference all of them in the paper, I hope we did cover. But in our case, drama was more, well, again, we used drama in two different ways. But I think it's brilliant to either get people to perform and try to put themselves in the situations or to give them more experiential scenario of designs that might be critical, yes. - So also the drama aspect, in connection with design, we also wanted to dramatize the issues that, or what would be a little bit problematic, what we hope people would find problematic, and act that out. - Yeah, and I must say that we left the actors to just do their job, and they were absolutely brilliant. They got it without, and they raised issues that we didn't think before. So for us, it was absolutely brilliant to work with them. Yeah, they're very creative and imaginative, and yeah. - So in this way, drama actually frames, or as a question, or a pitch, a problem, for people to consider it, rather than telling them that this is what we assume to be a problem for you. - [Moderator] Thank you, and this concludes our session for today. You've all been brilliant. ", "(audience applauding) ", ""], "evaluationData": {"boundariesAccuracy": 75.0, "timeAccuracy": 34.83, "structureAccuracy": 50.0, "mappingAccuracy": 95.94}}
