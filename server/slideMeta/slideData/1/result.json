We believe we can provide a fantastic template for precisely the kind of future that so much of HCI seems to want. Thank you. (applause) I guess I'm open to questions. (speaker and audience laughs) - That must have been the quickest talk ever. - Yeah. - So we have tons of time for these questions. I'm just saying in case you sit away from a microphone which is over here there is also Michael, an incredibly helpful student volunteer who is giving you papers, and then I will read out the questions. - Oh that's cool. Okay. - Or you just keep on talking. - Yeah. I can keep going. (laughs) - [Audience Member] My question is... - Please use a microphone. - [Audience Member] Okay. Hi. I really liked your talk. I really appreciate the kind of perspective it came from. My question maybe isn't as humorous. Maybe a little more of the dull sincere perspective. But I think this is raising some interesting points and I kind of want to ask a straight forward question. So are fairness, accountability, and transparency fundamentally flawed? Like we need to rework them? Or are they just really easy to do badly? - Yeah. I don't want to speak for Oz. But, my opinion on this is that there are severe problems with sort of uncritical following of fairness, accountability, transparency as the guidepost by which we make all of our decisions about algorithmic systems. This is a very clear illustration that if you follow it without even looking at where it's leading you you will find yourself in this place where you're making decisions where you are hurting marginalized communities just because, it's for instance, the will of the majority that made a decision about it. So to some extent, yes. I think that there is this fundamental flaw with these values. - [Audience Member] Sorry. I apologize in advance. I don't do HCI at all. But my question is... It seems to me that what you're raising is the fact that you need to have a goal that is morally acceptable. So how does HCI in general think about goals? - Wow. That's a really good question. Can I ask for a follow up? Like sort of an answer to my follow up question. Can you contextualize goals? Because one thought that I have is that the algorithms that Facebook uses are fairly accountable to the engineers and the managers at Facebook. And so they have a goal. And they're quite happy with how things are going for the most part. (laughs) - [Audience Member] I don't know. I'm actually a vision scientist. I study human optics. So nothing to do with Facebook. - Interesting. - [Audience Member] My question is in general, how does the HCI world think about how they implement systems and processes to help people and organizations, entities, agents, achieve their goals. And how do they think about goals in that context? - Gosh. That's a really good question. I think ... - [Audience Member] It's really like a naive question. I'm not trying to raise any sort of difficult point. I apologize. - You're raising a difficult point because it's a validly difficult question. I think maybe this is controversial. I think that CHI is a very large field. And there are people that have different opinions about how they go... what the goal of HCI is to some extent. My opinion is that the goal of HCI is to reflect and try to meet the desires of the people that use systems and work and live within ecosystems. But that's potentially different from a corporate goal or a corporate interest. - [Audience Member] So, I guess my question was... Let's say that there is a goal and you're trying to implement a solution that goes to your goal. And you're going to use those principles. How do you incorporate the goal that you are trying to achieve into the way you think about that process? That's not really the goal of HCI. It's the goal of whatever agent or whatever agent you're trying to build a process for. I guess - If I understand you correctly, I think that essentially my answer is you need to talk with and work with the people that you are trying to... The people at the core of that goal. That means participatory design, working with people, listening to people, and reflecting on what they tell you. And I hope that to some extent answers your question. I would love to chat more if you have more thoughts on that. - [Audience Member] Sure. I don't have thoughts. - Oh. Okay. (audience laughs) - [Audience Member] Thank you. That is very interesting. You trigger a lot of interesting things. I wanted... Do you think it would help if you would see these concepts: fairness, accountability, and transparency as social constructs that are only defined in a social contract? - Yeah. Absolutely. And they're also contextually defined. Things like transparency are very situational. Like if I asked... I'm sort of plugging the talk I gave yesterday. If I asked a police officer how many people he's pulled over that day, he might give me an answer. If I filed a freedom of information request and asked how many people had been pulled over on that street that day by that police officer I might get a different kind of answer. But these are all sort of valid processes or valid routes towards getting information. So it's contextual depending on the situation. And the way that I ask for that information. But I do think that you are absolutely right. That our notion of fairness are culturally situated in our notions of ethics and philosophy. And we don't talk about that that much, especially in the ML community. There's sort of like driving that fairness without talking about what that exactly is. And some researchers have pointed out that depending on your definition of fairness I mean, you might have a bunch of cis white men get mulched up, but that's because we're not really talking about what fairness is. Or what or definition of fairness is. - [Audience Member] But then what will be the way forward you think? - We need to have more concrete, more explicit conversations about what these things mean. And I think this is driving at that pretty aggressively. - [Audience Member] Thanks. - [Audience Member] Hi. I love the talk and paper. I sent it to my dad. Told him I wasn't getting any ideas. - (laughs) Okay. I no ... (laughs) - [Audience Member] (laughs) No. I was wondering could you extend a little bit more on your thoughts about... Sorry. Can you extend a little bit more on your thoughts about accountability specifically, because you guys did provide in fact a way that is technically accountable, but in that sense it's very much the way that you do it. And so how would you think about the right way to contextualize accountability? - I mean, unfortunately, the short answer to that is that it depends on the context. And depending on the application of the system and the way that it's designed. There are different ways that you need to go about accountability. That can't be sort of answered in a blanket fashion, which again, is a frustrating thing for machine learning experts and people that sort of apply AI and all that other stuff in this way. But that's just the reality. Anything involving people is going to be difficult. - [Audience Member] Gotcha. Thank you. - [Audience Member] Hello. Obviously, the piece is amazing. But, I feel like what this piece actually highlights is not so much the problems in fairness, accountability, and transparency. Which obviously there are many. But actually the fact that this is a layer on top of something that is already troublesome which is what are we doing? The kinds of questions we're trying to answer. The kinds of programs we're making are often unethical from the beginning and F.A.T. won't fix it. I feel like focusing on... This piece actually shows you how focusing on F.A.T. is useless because we haven't even started talking about the underlying foundation of the work. So I really appreciated the way this sort of absurd example highlights that. But the thing is that there are so many real world examples that are doing this. And I hope that this parody encourages others to notice that we are mulching old people. (laughs) - Yes. Thank you for refocusing that. This paper is trying to call out that these are goals that we have taken for granted as the right thing that we should be doing. And even... I guess How do I say this generously? It is impossible for us to achieve a socially, pro-social, socially acceptable outcome given what we want out of society if we're just chasing after fairness, accountability, and transparency. Again, without even thinking about what those things mean. But then not even going beyond any of those three tenets. But yeah. Thank you for pointing that out more clearly. Thank you all so much.", "ocrResult": " text Conclusion + Fairness, Accountability and Transparency is an ideal ethical framework for Al We have demonstrated this through our collaboration with LNI We
