Thank you so much, thank you. (audience clapping) - Wonderful, thank you, Maria. And we'd like to invite any questions, so if you do have a question, please raise your hand clearly. And there's a few at the front here. - You look like my coauthor, Fannie, so I was like, \"Fannie's gonna ask a question?\" But you're not, okay. - No. But I do have a question really quickly, obvious one, in and out. What do you think about this result of role-modeling actually having a negative influence? Is there something in the literature suggesting that that would happen? Because anecdotally from personal experience, I think we often find that valuable. - So actually, in mentoring literature, role-modeling is considered one of the functions of mentoring. However, I don't think, because it is very contextual to the mentor, people do not, most likely, when they see this kind of information, they just waive it. So this is why we have no significant effect with the original requester, or when third parties read these, more likely they are thinking, \"This is irrelevant, \"this is not something that we would actually appreciate,\" so instead, they would prefer to see actual steps. That's my feeling. Yeah. Is there any other question that I can answer? - [Announcer] We have time for one other question, otherwise, I can ask one. So I'd really like to ask, in your paper, you talked about the difference between online support and off-line support, and also automated support could be a future direction, what are the kind of challenges in providing automated mentoring and other places where that would be appropriate and inappropriate? - Okay, that's a very interesting question. So I think one of the challenges is how we can integrate the relational component of mentoring, and I had a little bit of that in my slides, but because I'm out of time. So most of the time, like in the case of health online communities, you see extended relationships, wherein career mentoring, people just go, they're ad hoc interactions. They go, they post their question, they get the response, they leave, so, one, I think, of the challenges is how we can have extended relationships online that they can actually help the people throughout their careers, especially, for people who do not have access to mentors, and believe me, there are many out there. So I think that can be a way that automation can actually help people, as mechanics of the extending part of the relationship. - [Announcer] Wonderful, please join me in thanking Maria. - Thank you so much, thank you.

someone more experienced within or outside an organization who supports the personal and professional growth of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [14].", " Seeking and sustaining career mentoring through in-person interactions contributes to learning and career growth [36].", " Resources that support \"offline mentorship\" range from traditional mentoring to mentoring between peers at work [35], to career-focused social networks (i.e., distributed mentoring from different social sources such as peers, friends, and family [27]), to career professionals such as executive coaches [17] and formal mentoring programs.", " Despite the benefits of career mentoring [36], many working adults lack access to in-person mentors.", " For instance, underrepresented groups within a profession have limited career-focused or developmental social networks [29].", " Moreover, most of theworking population cannot afford expensive career professionals [5, 22].", " Offline career mentoring relationships can also be dysfunctional.", " People may experience sabotage, envy, harassment or bullying from mentors, which can hamper career success [13, 49, 51].", " Online career mentoring offers a unique opportunity to remove some of the burdens and costs of traditional mentoring.", " In particular, online Q&A forums support a rich variety of knowledge exchange [24, 39, 56], but prior work has not yet examined whether and how these forums support career advice seeking or mentoring functions.", " For instance, interactions in these forums may be useful for exchanging information, but they tend to be ad hoc, i.e., they lack a previous history of interaction.", " Thus, they may fail to support the relational aspect of offline mentoring.", " Nonetheless, understanding these ad hoc dynamics are especially important as new digitally enabled forms of mentoring emerge (e.g., virtual coaches, online communities, and distributed mentoring) [23, 54] that people may rely on for career advice and support.", " In this paper, we use archival data from an online Q&A forum focused on career support to extend the literature on online career mentorship.", " We examine the ad hoc dynamics of seeking and receiving career advice.", " We leverage online community interactions to identify the types of career challenges people face today.", " We also compare the functions of offline and online mentoring (social support, informational, and role modeling; [11, 35]) and provide implications for what people value as career advice.", " We differentiate those who seek career advice online into two types: 1) the original requesters who experience a challenge and seek advice through a post, and 2) the third party (external) viewers who may face similar experiences or are interested in learning, i.e., anyone who will search for similar questions online.", " Our study focuses on three research questions:", " \u2022 RQ1: What kind of career advice requests do people make in an online community?", " \u2022 RQ2: Do different career advice requests elicit different kind of responses?", " \u2022 RQ3:What kinds of responses to career advice requests are most valued?", " We contribute to the CSCW literature in three ways.", " First, we provide a taxonomy of online career advice that designers may leverage to help users to navigate their questions (if requesters) or to share their expertise (if mentors/contributors).", " Second, we develop a new scale that allows future research to further examine the effects and functions of online career advice mentoring.", " Finally, we empirically demonstrate the nature of online career mentoring and the advice that is valued in such contexts."], [" A number of researchers in HCI have studied different areas of career development and careers in general.", " One direction of work examines the role of technological interventions in disadvantaged and low resourced workforce [25, 57].", " For example, Dillahunt et al.", " explored how job seekers from low socioeconomic status leverage technology to find jobs [12].", " Another direction investigates career skills development, identifying how digital technologies promote learning and communication through online communities [16, 34] and recommendation systems, e.g., Crowd Coach, which facilitates peer coaching while people work [9].", " Similarly, research on e-mentoring (mentoring via electronic communications for education purposes [53]) considers interactions organized around professional activities [6, 7].", " For example, MentorNet is a structured e-mentoring program that pairs female college students with professionals in engineering and science [32].", " Our research contributes to this field by examining the type and value of career advice people seek and receive online.", " Career mentoring can come from not only a dedicated mentor, but also professional coaches, peers, friends, and family.", " Mentoring sources can be formal through assigned or professional mentors or mentoring programs, which is known to have limited impact, or informal through relationships and interactions external to an organization [8].", " Mentoring sources can be viewed as a developmental network, i.e., a group of people with an active interest in and action toward advancing one\u2019s career.", " Career progress is associated with having a series of mentoring relationships or a configuration of mentors over the course of one\u2019s career [27].", " E-mentoring is a mentoring source less related to organizational context that can increase mentorship access and provide similar support as offline mentoring [43, 52].", " Studies within health and education online communities suggest that e-mentoring can contribute to users\u2019 well-being, learning, and skill acquisition through the feedback and support received [7, 56].", " Similar to e-mentoring, career mentoring in online communities may promote users\u2019 careers through support from users with similar experiences, experts, or the crowd in general.", " However, both offline mentoring and e-mentoring tend to be dyadic and part of ongoing relationships developed within private channels, while career mentoring in online communities enables people to post publicly to a large audience of potential mentors.", " In our research, we focus on a widely-used source of online career mentoring: Q&A forums.", " Online Q&A Forums as a Source of Career Mentoring.", " Q&A forums are online communities for sharing expertise, where individuals can pose questions and receivemultiple responses from a broad set of individuals [2].", " In Q&A forums, the advice seeker may have little previous mentorship interactions.", " Prior work has examined the content and dynamics of these systems, such as on Yahoo Answers [2], Quora [47, 55], and StackOverflow [39], but has yet to explore the nature of the career mentoring interactions in such environments.", " Q&A forum interactions differ in nature and structure from offline mentorship.", " In Q&A forums, questions are public to a relatively unknown and often anonymous audience of many potential respondents [24].", " Questions on Q&A forums such as StackOverflow can also receive responses very quickly, often within 12 minutes [39].", " These forums rely on a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to participate, including through visible reputation markers and connections to one\u2019s interests and identities [28].", " Responses to questions can benefit the person who originally asked the question as well as the third-party

Oh, it does work, okay. Thank you all for joining our session today, and welcome to CHI. Being the first presenter, I think I should say this. So my name is Maria Tomprou. I'm postdoctoral research fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, and today I'm going to present you our study on Career Mentoring in Online Communities and how people seek and receive advice. And this is a joint work with my co-authors, Laura Dabbish, Robert Kraut, and Fannie Liu. So mentoring has been documented ", "as a valuable career resource, and it typically refers to the support people get professionally and personally for their growth throughout their career pathway. ", "There is enough research suggesting that there are both benefits and downsides. On the side of the benefits, people experience career growth, report career growth, career satisfaction and learning. However, when you don't have a good match with your mentor, then it's more likely to experience sabotage, feelings of sabotage, depression, and psychological withdrawal (sighing). ", "Nonetheless, if you don't have a mentor, it may have its own consequences. So research suggests that the people without mentors, without any kind of mentoring source, experience isolation, professional stagnation, and job dissatisfaction, so you do need some kind of mentoring throughout your careers, and especially in academia, we all know that. ", "So in HCI literature and research has focused in career research in two main research venues. The one is job search and how people use technology to find jobs, especially, for underserved population and youth. We also have enough research on how people use technology and e-mentoring for educational purposes.

So by going online and seeing what other people have, question and answer, you may benefit and learn from that. ", "And that takes us to the third and final research question. What kind of responses are most valued? Both from our original requester but also from third-party observers. ", "We had Study 1, where we actually tried to develop a taxonomy of career advice requests, and then, in Study 2, we wanted to understand to what extent these career advice requests elicit different types of responses and which of these responses are actually valued both from the requester but also from other people.

Our final data set was 470 posts with the tags \"Career Development\" or \"Careers\". Every few months, Stack Exchange releases their data dumps on archives, so people can go, and research can go use it for their research purposes. So we used this pool of posts, and we had one coder, that went thorough the 470 posts and analyzed them from bottom to top, resulting in three main types of career advice requests that I will be presenting you.

So let's go through each one of them and see some examples.

The second type of career advice request is threats ", "to career progress, seeking advice for problems that may hamper your career. ", "and at some point, they transferred him to another project, and he started hating it. So he's considering leaving the organization. And he's going online and, actually, he's posting his problem, seeking for advice. ", "Managing Relationships, how can I manage my relationship within the organization? How can I manage failures? How can I resign? How can I prove myself within my organization? How can I balance health problems without affecting my career progress? And how can I keep myself motivated? ", "And the last type of the career advice request was seeking advice for solutions or input on a timely fashion, on a time-sensitive fashion. ", "You have this user who just accepted an offer, and then, the employer comes with a counteroffer. So he's going online and asks some advice on how to deal with the problem. ", "Four types here of time-sensitive decision making themes: how people can manage a negotiation, Job Offers, how can they can avoid tasks or projects, and ethical issues. ", "So, overall, we found three types of career advice requests, so the question here is, do these type of requests elicit different types of responses, and what of these responses are actually most valued? ", "And that leads us to Study 2. ", " ", "So, again, these are the two types of requests. I'm not gonna go through them. ", "We collected 36 posts for that data set, with one accepted and one nonaccepted answer, that leading us to 72 pairs. And we coded responses using Amazon Mechanical Turk, so they rated both on the content and the value of the response. For the content, we developed 13 items based on mentoring literature as well as observations of our corpus, and with the value, we measured with two items on a six Likert-type scale, asking them, \"To what extent do you think \"that was a helpful answer?\" and \"How much effort does the requester \"actually put to give the answer?\" ", "And this is an example of how the Mturk response coding look like. We first gave the question and then the answer, ", "of the value measure, and we asked them to rate each response. ", "We ran a Principal Component Analysis to identify the main types of responses, and we ended up with a 4-Factor solution that explained 68% of the variance. Two items were dropped, so our final scale was 11, our final measure was 11 items. ", "So let's go through the factors of career advice requests. The first one was General information provision. The information can be applied to multiple situations or multiple individuals. ", "The second one was Encouragement, the extent to which the career advice giver provides some effort to help the requester feel better but also look forward. ", "The third one was Role-modeling, to what extent the career advice giver actually offers personal experiences and to what extent these were positive. ", "And the fourth one was Guidance, problem-solving strategies and steps that they are tailored to the original request. ", "do these three request types elicit different types of responses? And we used Linear regression for nested data, to answer our question. ", "So and then, for our next and final research question is, what kind of responses are most valued both from the person who is asking the question but also from third parties? ", "So for the Requester acceptance, you will use Logistic regression because you have a binary outcome, accepted, nonaccepted. And for the Third party ratings, we used Linear regression. ", "So our findings show that Guidance is this factor that actually can predict the likelihood of an answer to be accepted, of a response to be accepted from the original requester. ", "In terms of with the third parties' evaluations, we found that not only Guidance actually considered useful to the valuable response but also General Information and Encouragement. And interestingly enough, when people actually share personal experiences, this was less appreciated, so it was negatively related with the value of the response. ", "So in summary, responses were not request dependent, posts with Guidance are four times more likely to be accepted, and third parties value General Information, Encouragement, and Guidance. Role-modeling is less appreciated. ", "So in terms of for our Design Implications, how can we design better career-related online communities? So in the paper, we have a few of our Design Implications that you can go and read further, but I'm gonna focus on one. ", "Our main one was promoting career advice response that users will actually value. So, for example, having an Intelligent response critic that help the person who is actually giving the advice to provide responses that are Guidance-related so they can increase the likelihood of acceptance from the original requester. ", "and general information can benefit third parties, and this is something that we can also actually implement to improve career-related online communities.
