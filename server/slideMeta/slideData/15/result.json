7 illustrates the volume that was sampled, from a Z height that starts with the coil level with the fingernail.", " At each location the participant was asked to rate how strongly they perceived the

demonstrates that, while the strength generally declines with distance, the pattern is more complex.", " For example, at z = 60mm the area directly on top of the centre of the coil provides relatively weak feedback, compared above or below the centre on the x-axis.", " With knowledge of such patterns, haptic widgets can be created that are even further away from the device than 56.6mm, if one places them in areas where the feedback can", " be clearly perceived.", " Alternatively, these variances in perceived strength could be corrected for, by taking the position of the finger into account when providing feedback.", " c) Measurements of Magnetic Field If the perceived strength correlated directly with the magnetic field, we could leverage the existing know-how of magnetic fields for strength calibration or widget-placement strategies, as discussed above.", " To better understand the patterns found in the previous user study, we therefore repeated the procedure.", " This time, instead of asking participants to rate the strength of the vibration, we placed a magnetometer where the participants finger would be and measured the strength of the magnetic field produced by the coil.", " The magnitude of the field strength correlates well with the haptic feedback (R = .805, Figure 7, right) but does not completely explain all variations.", " At z = 60mm, the magnitude hardly

demonstrate how magnetips might benefit familiar interactions.", " We believe, however, that the opportunities offered by the unique combination of colocated tracking and haptic feedback, in
