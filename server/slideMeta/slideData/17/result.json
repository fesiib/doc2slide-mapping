(audience claps) - I just want to highlight the fact that we've got microphones, so please if you have any questions if you can move closer to the microphones and if you'd kindly state your name and affiliation so Colin can get back to you. So any questions? Any questions? - [Audience Member, Doug] Doug Svane, (murmurs affiliation) Norway. Did you encounter any situations where there were actual conflicts? - So a bit. So the instance with James where I really provided the central case was an example where there was this conflict between what the shareholder wanted and this came up in the context of project meetings. So that's probably the closest we saw to conflict. In the other two environments, the ethical concern was so low, or the awareness of ethical concern was so low, that it never came to a point of tension, and I think this is where we really characterize the difference between what we've found and what is currently supported by other methods like VSD, where VSD requires that awareness to already be there and then these cases in a lot of these organizational contexts that awareness wasn't even able to happen because of the constraining forces on the designer. - [Doug] Thank you. - [Audience Member, Michael] Michael Veale from the Alan Turing Institute. I was wondering a lot of the issues that are coming up in many areas of Computer Science around ethics are actually quite difficult to analyze, they take a lot of manpower and effort and time. How did you find that that time could be, you know, basically acquired by somebody in this context, because there are some things that maybe surface quite easily, like you were talking about dark patterns and broad business models and some things that require deeper analysis. - It's a good question, one which I do not have fulfilling answer for yet. The third paper in this session will present a quite labor intensive method to do some of this ethical evaluation work. We're hoping in our next steps, based on the work that we discovered here, to identify more methods to align with some of the specific mediating tensions that we've identified, but I don't have anything more productive to share at the moment. Thank you. - I do have a question myself. Did you ever ask the participants to actually define what ethics are? - We did not, and so in the follow-up interview at the end, we did engage them in quite a lengthy discussion about ethics, about dark patterns, which is the larger framing of some of our work, and we did sort of get a sense from them about what they felt ethics and values were, but we never explicitly asked them for a definition. We had enough interactions with them, though, that we were able to triangulate pretty well what ethical paradigm or paradigms they might be arguing from and that's certainly something that we present a little bit of in the paper. Thank you. - Let's thank Colin again. (audience claps)", "ocrResult": " text THANK YOU COLIN M.

ethical engagement, such as Shilton\u2019s \u201cvalue levers\u201d [41] provides a designer-centric means of exploring and acting upon emergent ethical concerns, placing the emphasis more", " closely on the designer and her agency rather than on a specific methodology for design engagement.", " Despite the increasing expectations for professionals to be strongly aware of the ethical roles they play through practice, driven by the ubiquity of technologies in worldwide-use and increase in goods being used in differing global contexts, there is little in situ research that provides a rich account of how ethics and values are addressed in professional design practice.", " There are rare examples of this type of in situ research, primarily in the STS literature.", " Shilton [42] identified the emergence of values in infrastructure design, using reflection on values as a means of engaging technologists in the ethical dimensions of their praxis.", " Steen [45] analyzed ICT application development practices through the lens of pragmatist ethics, identifying locations within the \u201cblack box\u201d of design where ethical concerns can be addressed in a reflexive manner.", " Finally, vanWynesberghe and Robbins [49] proposed a heightened role for ethicists in supporting scientific work\u2014the \u201cethicist as designer\u201d\u2014leading to a method for uncovering, scrutinizing, and translating values through the design process.", " Verbeek [50] also provides philosophical insight into the ethical dimensions of technological artifacts, describing the

previous empirical and philosophical efforts to more fully describe the rich contexts in which ethical concerns emerge and reflexively shape design processes.", " We situate our work as part of a larger \u201cturn to practice\u201d in HCI scholarship [28, 29], attending to not only the epistemological commitments of design in its third paradigm [11], but also the need to bridge practitioner and researcher knowledge through dissemination pathways [22].", " Our goal is to reveal and describe contextual and situated factors that contribute to design complexity [46], particularly focusing on the role that designers play in foregrounding and addressing ethical concerns.", " Prior work in a practice-led framing inform the present study.", " In particular, we build upon the work of Goodman [19] and Zhang and Wakkary [53] in describing the complex landscape of practice that is shaped by organizational factors and personal expertise.", " We also recognize that designers, broadly speaking, have the capacity to engage in substantive conversations around ethical concerns, using concepts such as dark patterns in discussions on social media [6, 12].", " Finally, we draw on the work of Gray,", " Gross, and Toombs [23] in recognizing that design competence and performance are not static, but rather exist in a dynamic interplay of foregrounded and explicit awareness by individual and organizational actors.", " In the present study, we blend these insights to describe more fully how UX practitioners engage in the design complexity of their work, and motivate this work through ethical or value-related commitments that shape\u2014and are shaped by\u2014organizational and personal factors.", " In this paper, we build upon prior work on activity theory in general (e.g., [3, 25, 35, 36]), and particularly on the notion of mediation.", " As Nardi [36] states: \u201cactivity theory proposes a strong notion of mediation\u2014all human experience is shaped by the tools and sign systems we use.\u201d Activity theory more broadly contends that we cannot view actors or technological artifacts in isolation, but rather we must always understand interactions as simultaneously involving mediating actions from multiple sources that shape, constrain, or extend action possibilities.", " In this paper, we also draw on the work of Kou and Nardi [27], who describe the value of using the language of complex mediation to analyze patterns of interaction over time that involve both human and technological actors.", " While we use the concept of mediation in a relatively imprecise way in our analysis of practitioner interactions with ethics without fully exploring the semiotic dimensions that are implied by the engagement of practitioners with particular design artifacts or disciplinary codes of ethics, we anticipate that future work might sharpen this language further, making it a more useful tool for evaluating the design complexity of these interactions, and the system-level mediators that shape immediate design decisions, and the momentum of these decisions over time."], [" In this study, we sought to identify and describe the ethical principles and related values that UX practitioners relied upon \u201con the ground.\u201d To achieve this goal, we collected data through an on-site observational study and follow-up interviewswith UX designers

participant (i.e., Hawthorne Effect).", " During each observation, handwritten field notes were produced by two researchers, constituting the primary data collection method.", " Prior to engaging in the observations, each researcher was trained through at least two scaffolding observations, increasing the ability of the researcher to reliably capture complex work practices, speech acts, and", "

regarding design decisions, and researcher notes/memos.", " After each observation was completed, the field notes were collaboratively converted into digital narratives to combine the notes and observations of both the researchers to constitute a \u201cthick\u201d record [9].", " Follow-up Interviews.", " After the final observation, researchers conducted a 60-90 min follow-up interview with the participant.", " This interview was intended to clarify researcher notes from the observations and broadly document the perceptions of the participants regarding the role of ethics and values in

experiences that guided these decisions, and other relevant actors or environmental cues that appeared to be salient in the observation.", " After the conclusion of these observation-focused questions, we also engaged the participant in a discussion of \u201cdark patterns\u201d and other ethical considerations in UX, which included solicitation of questions regarding user/stakeholder balance, and whether the participant had been asked to make design decisions that made them uncomfortable.", " We concluded with an open question asking how they assessed the ethical implications of their design decisions, with no definition of ethics or other conceptual framing provided.", " We did not provide a definition of ethics, values, or other framing concepts to our participants before the observations or during the interview debrief.", " These interviews were audio recorded with the consent of the participants.", " The recordings were transcribed and cleaned, and were used in conjunction with the thick record to facilitate data analysis.", " The thick records and interview transcripts of each participant were analyzed to form conceptually similar chunks", " of events and activities.", " Patterns of similar activities were noted both in the process of performing observations, as well as in post-hoc analysis by multiple researchers.", " These chunks represented different observed themes regarding the practices at the workplace of each participant, including: concept brainstorming, stand-up meetings, client discussions, review/critique sessions, and so on.", " Once the themes were identified, all chunks were first analyzed individually to understand the actors involved, the decision making processes the actors engaged with, areas of tension in beliefs versus actions and any in-context discussion or later reflection in the interview.", " Once the main activity-related themes were identified, three main themes emerged through a bottom-up thematic analysis [5] that helped us to describe the richness within and across cases in relation to ethical awareness and decision making: 1) individual practices of the participant related/unrelated to their work environments; 2) organizational practices or policies which were evident throughout the team; and 3) the individual and specific examples that guided us to understand their ethical awareness and practices.", " While writing the case studies, we used an interpretive approach [40] to describe ethical concerns on the participant\u2019s own terms, using their own words wherever possible.", " The

John, he also overlapped ethical and legal considerations, with seemingly more focus on saving the agency from legal issues than engaging in human values on their own merits.", " While we were able to see this overlap throughout his design activities, in the follow-up interview, he provided more detail on a specific set of design decisions: \u201cThat [feature is] violating HIPAA.", " Violating some legal framework, or it just emotionally, so doesn\u2019t sit well with me.\u201d This bifurcation of ethics and legality also appeared when he identified and activated specific feature lists

\u201ctwenty-five percent of what we do\u201d to ensure that the situation is \u201clegally protected,\u201d but that the main focus was on the contract with the organization and the money that they were willing to pay.", " This also came through in John\u2019s relationship with usercentered design principles.", " He regularly discussed situations with his colleagues where a client might profit

product, mentioning that his role as a designer is to serve his clients.", " This allegiance to client needs makes him particularly sensitive to the kinds of projects that he took on, with concern towards projects that take advantage of minorities or economically disadvantaged groups, or issues of racial injustice in relation to project outcomes.", " Thus, even while there was often a tense,

for design processes to be iterative, but forms a boundary with the available resources of time and money.", " In this way, his organization constrains the design situation such that their clients

calls this activity \u201clandscaping\u201d or \u201cdeconstructing approach to brands.\u201d This critical approach is highly individual, drawing on each designer\u2019s unique perspective, with the acknowledgment that \u201danalyzing [the trends] keeps our judgments and taste high.\u201d This critique and reflection encourages each designer to keep up-to-date on visual and interactive trends, allowing them to take inspiration from these materials and develop their own aesthetic sense that is \u201ctimeless, trendy, but not fashionable.\u201d In James\u2019 retelling, this allows the agency

cases, we have identified three primary sets of knowledge and practices that relate to the designers\u2019 work (Figure 1).", " The individual\u2019s practices (A) describe the personal experiences and commitments that are unique to the designer, and the ways in which the awareness of one\u2019s practices in a reflective and reflexive manner might be brought to bear on a design situation.", " The organizational practices (B) describe the structure and purpose of the organization where design activity is taking place, and the ways in which these structures shape the substance and outcomes of design processes.", " Finally, applied ethics (C) describe the knowledge that is built through formal education or participation in professional societies, and the ways in which this knowledge might indicate ethically-correct behavior or responsibility.", " In the three cases, we see a diverse range of perspectives indicated through these sets of knowledge and practices.", " In the first case, John had a personal interest in the social impact of design and the needs of users (A) which was constrained by the contractual functioning of his job within the agency (B); this relationship was further complicated by values from user-centered design (C) that contradicted or supported John\u2019s personal practices.", " In the second case, James had a clear sense of how his ethical commitments mapped across the development of his own design character (A) and the mission of the company he helped to manage (B); these commitments were regularly refreshed and shaped by academic studies in biology, neuroscience, and psychology that provided external perspectives on ethics (C) that related to his personal behaviors.", " In the third case, Martha\u2019s personal practices drew broadly from UX, programming and design (A), yet these practices and experiences were constrained by the B2B focus and the primary goal of improving security within the organization (B); in this case, the goal of security and usability provided a set of desirable indicators for success (C), but was primarily oriented towards organizational rather than personal practices.", " Based on the proposal of multiple practices and knowledge that constrain or extend ethical awareness in design activity from the last subsection, we also propose a set of directional ethical mediators that characterize these relationships.", " While not all of these mediators are present in the cases, this framework provides a means of analyzing potential and actual relationships that inform and shape ethically-informed action.", " The cases of James and John provide two perspectives on the power of mediation.", " Whereas James was constrained by organizational practices (B->A)\u2014thereby suppressing his own goals as a user-centered, social-justice-aware, designer\u2014 John was directed by his inner sense of character and ethics, which was then used to extend and inform the creation

Good morning to everyone. My name is Colin Gray and I'm presenting this paper on behalf of the UX Pedagogy and Practice Lab at Purdue University, and for the excellent work of my coauthor Shruthi Chivukula, and you'll be hearing from her in the third slot here today. So in this talk, I'm going to present a practice-led, in situ account of the UX designers' practices from an ethics perspective, increasing knowledge about how practitioners engage in everyday ethics as an important component of their work. Through a set of three diverse cases, I'm going to describe the everyday work practices of UX designers, shaped by multiple mediating factors that constrain, shape or direct the ethical impact of design decisions.  text Ethical in UX Practice", "in describing the complex nature of UX practice, focusing on the subjective, yet professional knowledge that designers rely upon to support their practice. In parallel with this increased interest in studying design practice on its own terms, HCI and STS scholars have sought to describe the ethical and value-laden relationship between designers and design outcomes and the role of design knowledge in informing ethically-centered practice. However, despite decades of interest by design and technology scholars regarding the importance of engaging in ethical practice, little research describes the ethical engagement of design practitioners on the ground and on its own terms.  text", "of the importance of ethics in design and technology education in fields of science, engineering, technology and in academia. However, as you're likely aware if you ever read the news headlines, this awareness has not generally led to the increased ability on the part of practitioners to work or act in an ethically aware manner despite the existence of numerous existing methods, frameworks and codes.  text", "Steen, Verbeek, van Wynsberghe and other STS scholars to situate our research, furthering a rich account of how ethics and values are addressed or could be addressed in professional design practice. In particular, we intend to more fully describe the rich context in which ethical concerns emerge and reflexively shape design processes.  text", "Practice-led research efforts in HCI have revealed aspects of the remarkable complexity that defines design practice, but the pragmatic and situational roles of ethics is still often under-determinized and under-theorized in the design and HCI literature. Many existing efforts to describe ethical practices in a range of research and design contexts rely upon common framings of ethics from philosophy, including perspectives such as consequentialist, duty, virtue and care ethics. We choose not to explicitly use any of these perspectives a priori in grounding this study and instead seek to identify and describe ethical considerations that are described by practitioners on their own terms.  text", "The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First we document cases that describe the emergence or suppression of ethical decision-making in UX practice, detailing the interactions and positionality of the designer within each case. This provides new knowledge about how ethical awareness and decision-making emerge, without guiding methods or frameworks on the ground, and the practitioner's role in this work.  text", "of mediation, building upon the existing work from activity theory to identify how organizational, personal and ethical frameworks impact, shape or extend design practices. And this provides further guidance in exploring the role of pragmatist ethics in describing and managing design complexity.  text", "To achieve these goals, we used a multiple case study approach, with each participant-organization pair serving as a case unit, and we viewed each case study holistically in the write up. The primary goal of case study research is not generalizable, although the rich detail obtained in each case can be expected to lead to insights or hypotheses that may guide future research.  text", "through three primary phases. First we conducted interviews or observations with three expert UX practitioners in a range of work contexts in the United States. Two researchers documented their experience with handwritten field notes which were later combined into a detailed thick record. These observations were completed across two or three sessions, totaling seven to 10 contact hours per case, with the goal of documenting design complexity in each of these organizational contexts on its own terms. All research activities were approved by our institutional IRB and all direct and indirect participants in the observations were consented. Each participant is referred to by a pseudonym and the elements of the work context are anonymized to protect the participants and their organization. Second after the final observation session, either two or three, we conducted 60 to 90 minute follow-up interview  text", "of each participant were analyzed to form conceptually similar chunks. We began with creating chunks of the main activity-related themes and three main themes emerged  text Case Study Approach", "through a bottom-up thematic analysis that helped us to describe the richness within and across cases in relation to ethical awareness in decision-making. We found that these were really shaped around three areas.  text Case Study Approach", "One was the individual practices of participants, related to or unrelated to their work environments. Second, the organizational practices or policies which were evident throughout the team, and third, the individual and specific examples that guided us to understand, in an applied way, their ethical awareness and practices.  text Case Study Approach", "We identified multiple participants through a snowball sample, beginning from our personal and professional networks. Participants in the three cases ranged in experience from six to 11 years and currently work in a range of industry types across the United States, spanning enterprise, in-house agency and remote agency work. These participants brought different sets of work and educational experience and each played a different role in their team, ranging from consultant to manager to partner.  text", "to focus this presentation just on one of the three case studies, but the write up for all three, of course, are in the full paper. To support this case we completed 10 hours of observations in three different sessions with James's team of designers and concluded with a 90 minute follow-up interview.  text", "to client projects, specifically focusing on website applications. He's worked on the field of UX design for about 11 years and he's had more than three years at his current organization. Currently he leads a design team of more than six UX designers with a range of skillsets in user research, interaction design and graphic design. James has an educational background in UX design with a masters degree in HCI.  text", "we understood that he believes in, quote, \"regularly refreshing his knowledge to inform practice\" and he takes responsibility  text", "and he strikes a balance in ethically nuanced situations  text", "through your designs. I'm gonna discuss each one of these three themes in detail in the next few slides.  text", "to inform his practice. Through his actions and through the interviews he revealed that he believes that updating his store of knowledge, outside of design practice and the design world writ large, strengthens and helps him better evaluate his ethical behavior. He reads books based in the science of design and, more broadly, coming from biology, psychology and other fields to more fully understand human behavior and how his design work might fit within it. His regular refreshing of knowledge gives him contextual information about the application of values from other products, continuously building his repertoire of examples that might guide or shape his design practice. His refreshing of knowledge also helps him to engage in self-reflection on client projects and discussions and this helps him to form and articulate ethical judgments for critique or for developing design concepts. And these judgments frequently emerged in our observation session and in his reflection afterwards.  text", "Across all three of the cases, we found similar themes that exemplified the influence of situational factors  text", "  text", "And looking at all these occurrences we found that the designer was always at the center of the ethical mediation that was taking place among these three factors.  text", "in the discussion of the paper, presented a common mediator driven position of the designer at the core of the ethical complexities that were taking place between three things: individual practices, organizational practices and applied ethics. I'll briefly show you how some of these mediated interactions took place, using James' experience as an example.  text", "by organizational and individual practices, allowing his personal values to impact the construction of the agency environment, and for those organizational practices to then constrain the ethical actions of his employees. This stands in contrast to John and Martha's experiences where their organizational practices only constrained their action and their awareness of ethical concern.  text", "and infuse these lessons into his design practices, strengthened and broadened his ethical foundations. Allowing him to articulate clear beliefs about issues such as technology addiction. In contrast John's experience seemed to promote a disconnect or disjuncture between his ethical framing and his individual practices. He allowed his business strategist role and designer role to work independently, using his work practices to inscribe the distinction between these roles.  text", "we have sought to describe what we term ethical design complexity. This builds on Stolterman's notion of design complexity from his 2008 paper. By ethical design complexity, we refer to the complex and choreographed arrangements of ethical considerations that are continuously mediated by the designer through the lens of their organization, individual practices and ethical frameworks.  text", "As we look back towards our participants' work context, we see the need to further investigate how we might inculcate an ethical design character in design education and design practice.  text", "to develop additional methods to support designers' ethical awareness and ability to act. While existing frameworks, such as value-sensitive design, provide a helpful starting point, there is space for engaging more directly with a designer's ethical character and the forces that constrain or enable ethically centered action.  text", "for strengthening leadership roles for designers within organizations, allowing for designers to more fully impact the organizational constructions that might currently constrain ethical action, potentially leading to applied ethics that resonate with themes of social responsibility, equity and inclusion.  text", "I'd like to acknowledge the efforts of a number of researchers on the UXP2 Lab team for their efforts in data collection and analysis, including Riya Manocha, who's here in the audience, Jason Brier, Abby Perez and Chris Watkins. We also want to acknowledge the support of the National Science Foundation. And I am now open for questions. Thank you. (audience claps) - I just want to highlight the fact that we've got microphones, so please if you have any questions if you can move closer to the microphones and if you'd kindly state your name and affiliation so Colin can get back to you. So any questions? Any questions? - [Audience Member, Doug] Doug Svane, (murmurs affiliation) Norway. Did you encounter any situations where there were actual conflicts? - So a bit. So the instance with James where I really provided the central case was an example where there was this conflict between what the shareholder wanted and this came up in the context of project meetings. So that's probably the closest we saw to conflict. In the other two environments, the ethical concern was so low, or the awareness of ethical concern was so low, that it never came to a point of tension, and I think this is where we really characterize the difference between what we've found and what is currently supported by other methods like VSD, where VSD requires that awareness to already be there and then these cases in a lot of these organizational contexts that awareness wasn't even able to happen because of the constraining forces on the designer. - [Doug] Thank you. - [Audience Member, Michael] Michael Veale from the Alan Turing Institute. I was wondering a lot of the issues that are coming up in many areas of Computer Science around ethics are actually quite difficult to analyze, they take a lot of manpower and effort and time. How did you find that that time could be, you know, basically acquired by somebody in this context, because there are some things that maybe surface quite easily, like you were talking about dark patterns and broad business models and some things that require deeper analysis. - It's a good question, one which I do not have fulfilling answer for yet. The third paper in this session will present a quite labor intensive method to do some of this ethical evaluation work. We're hoping in our next steps, based on the work that we discovered here, to identify more methods to align with some of the specific mediating tensions that we've identified, but I don't have anything more productive to share at the moment. Thank you. - I do have a question myself. Did you ever ask the participants to actually define what ethics are? - We did not, and so in the follow-up interview at the end, we did engage them in quite a lengthy discussion about ethics, about dark patterns, which is the larger framing of some of our work, and we did sort of get a sense from them about what they felt ethics and values were, but we never explicitly asked them for a definition. We had enough interactions with them, though, that we were able to triangulate pretty well what ethical paradigm or paradigms they might be arguing from and that's certainly something that we present a little bit of in the paper. Thank you. - Let's thank Colin again. (audience claps)  text THANK YOU COLIN M. GRAY"], "evaluationData": {"boundariesAccuracy": 0, "timeAccuracy": 0, "structureAccuracy": 0, "mappingAccuracy": 0}}
