    "text": "ABSTRACT People eat every day and biting is one of the most fundamental and natural actions that they perform on a daily basis. Existing work has explored tooth click location and jaw movement as input techniques, however clenching has the potential to add control to this input channel. We propose clench interaction that leverages clenching as an actively controlled physiological signal that can facilitate interactions. We conducted a user study to investigate users’ ability to control their clench force. We found that users can easily discriminate three force levels, and that they can quickly confirm actions by unclenching (quick release). We developed a design space for clench interaction based on the results and investigated the usability of the clench interface. Participants preferred the clench over baselines and indicated a willingness to use clench-based interactions. This novel technique can provide an additional input method in cases where users’ eyes or hands are busy, augment immersive experiences such as virtual/augmented reality, and assist individuals with disabilities."

      "text": "Modern ubiquitous interaction is increasingly being enriched by hands-free and eyes-free input from areas such as the face [3, 13], breath [27, 29], feet [20] and mouth [4, 26, 28]. In this paper, we contribute to that literature by expanding the expressiveness of mouth, specifically clenching. We eat every day. Biting is one of the most common and fundamental actions that we perform on a daily basis. Biting can be useful in situations where a user’s hands or eyes (or both) are busy, for augmenting immersive user experiences such as virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), and for individuals with disabilities. For example, users can easily answer a phone call or control a music player when riding a bike. In addition to hands- and eyes-free properties, there are a number of reasons to leverage biting: it is common and natural hence it requires little training; it is subtle and therefore minimally distracting. Researchers have begun to develop mouth-based interactions, including tongue-based interfaces [28] and tooth-click interfaces [4, 40]. However, although tongue has been used for pointing [13, 26], and tooth clicking has been used for list selection and typing [4], there is value in exploring techniques for combining a range of spatio-temporal signals to support richer interactions, such as force and mouth region. In addition, a design space for interaction with the teeth needs to be developed. In this paper, we propose to use jaw clenching to create a jaw-based interface and explore a design space for clench input, which we define as a subset of biting in which the jaw is closed, but the force of pressure of the teeth against each other is changed. Jaw clenching is ideal for interaction because it can have many dimensions: force, length of time and location. The clench action is also subtle and low-impact, simply involving a squeezing of the jaw together. Clenching can support rich interactions since it can have multiple dimensions. Knowing how well users can control their clench force is fundamental for clench interaction design. We conducted a user study with a clench-controlled target acquisition task to"

      "text": "We evaluated the usability of clench interaction from two perspectives. A second user study was conducted to measure the performance of the best six clench actions in virtual reality (VR). We also conducted a third user study to evaluate the usability of clench interaction in a situation close to a real use case, bicycling, where users’ hands and eyes are busy (as an example of both discrete command input and value control patterns). Clench interaction is faster than baselines in most cases in both studies, and participants stated a willingness to use clench as a novel input technique since it can be performed easily and conveniently. We use an in-mouth pressure sensor to obtain direct and accurate real-time clench force measurements, which we designed to maximize the realism by keeping the sensor thickness to 1.50mm. We measure isometric clenching with molar teeth, i.e., teeth and jaw do not move during interactions and the only variation is given by clench force (see Figure 1). While this sensor serves our goal of developing a robust design space for clench interaction, a deployable implementation can easily use other sensors based on our study results, which help to define parameters for design. For example, electromyography (EMG) is a viable alternative if force accuracy is unimportant (as is indicated by our design space survey), since there is a strong linear relationship between clench force and EMG signal on temporalis [5, 10]. And the positions of temporalis are compatible with modern devices such as VR/AR headsets and smart glasses. Our contributions in this paper are threefold:"

      "text": "There have been a variety of interaction techniques designed that leverage the face. For example, Salem and Zhai [26] proposed to use the tongue for isometric pointing tasks. Cheng et al. [9] proposed to detect whether a user applied pressure to the cheek using the tongue, as a gesture for hands-free interaction. Goel et al. [13] further expanded the input bandwidth by measuring different positions on one’s face touched by the tongue that support richer interactive tongue gestures. Sahni and Bedri et al. [6, 25] measured the movement of a small magnet glued to one’s tongue and deformation in the ear canal caused by jaw movement to support a silent speech interface. Facial expression is another input modality that has been investigated extensively. Lyons et al. proposed to use facial expressions as gestures for controlling a musical interface [18], and used mouth movement recognized by a camera to augment text-entry [17]. Ando et al. [2, 3] proposed to employ face-related movements as part of a hands-free music player and content reader. Much less work has focused on employing teeth as an input modality [4]. The tooth-click interface, developed as an assistive technology, is closely related to our work. Both Kuzume [15] and Zhong et al. [40] used an in-ear bone-conduction microphone to detect tooth click sounds as an additional input technique. Ashbrook et al. [4] investigated the click sounds of five different pairs of teeth to expand input bandwidth. A number of previous works used tooth-click for interactions such as selection [22, 40], confirmation [15, 39] and mode switch [28] with a single and/or double click. However, such an interface mainly relies on a instantaneous tooth click. It cannot leverage information such as clenching force, or sustained clench actions, etc. Clench interaction extends the input space along these dimensions."

In addition, there is some research that has studied the relationship between clench force and EMG signals on masseter and temporal anterior muscles of the face. Bakke et al. [5] found a strong linear correlation (p < 0.05, r = 0.98-0.99) between bite force and unilateral masseter or temporal muscle activity within the range of 12.5 to 87.5% of maximal unilateral bite force at eight sample points. The linear correlation becomes weaker when the bite force approaches the maximum. Bilt et al. [32] found the correlation between maximum voluntary bite force and total muscle activity ranged between 0.54 to 0.57. However, in previous research, all the devices were either on the outside of the face and quite inaccurate for continuous bite force measurement, or were in between the top and bottom teeth and had non-negligible height, mostly around 8 to 10 mm [5, 10, 32, 36]. This vertical height during biting can greatly affect muscular activity [19] and a gnathodynamometer is too thick for practical usage. Ideally the height should be nearly zero and close to the neutral condition of the mouth and teeth. This is a big reason to clenching, which is a subset of biting that involves pressing the teeth together with minimal jaw movements. Moreover, whether in or out of the mouth, none of the previous work has explored the human ability to control bite force except maximum bite force [32] and bite duration [31]. In this work, we investigated users’ ability to use clenching, to control clench force, and further proposed a set of clench interaction techniques that extend even beyond this clench force dimension."

In addition, another common detection method is based on EMG signals. Zhang et al. designed 3-D printed glasses to detect chewing with EMG sensors placed near the temporal anterior muscles to detect muscular activity, and acceleration sensors to detect bone vibration [37]. They used their glasses for eating detection and achieved an F1 score of 0.770 with naturalistic data [38]. Blechert et al.

      "text": "We employed a within-subjects full factorial design with repeated measures. Four independent variables were included: visual feedback condition (FF, PF ), selection method (BC,DW, QR), the distance from the starting threshold to the target (D = 120, 305, 490, in pixel units, 576 is the maximum) and the number of clench force levels (N = 3, 4, 6, 8, corresponding target’s height H, are 192, 144, 96 and 72 in pixel units). We choose between 3 and 8 based on a pilot study involving three lab members. We found that 2 levels are very naive to distinguish and two is a limited number if we want to support rich interactions, while 10 levels are extremely difficult. In both feedback conditions, we used a Latin square to balance the appearance order of the selection method. D and N appeared in a randomized order. Participants repeated each condition three times. In order to have a balanced experiment, we took special cares when choosing D and H to appropriately distribute targets throughout the potential target space [24]. Figure 3 shows that D defines the target for a trial and indicates some location in the targets rather than the center of the target."

Not surprisingly, we found that fewer force levels led to better performance (see Figure 4). However, a small number of levels is not practical for interaction. Thus, our goal was to identify an appropriate maximum. Participant surveys suggest this number should be below 6 – they complained about the difficulty when N = 6 and 8 during the interview. “I felt very tired to finish the tasks when levels were more than four.” (P4). To identify an appropriate number of levels, we consider success rate. The rate were 92.3% for N = 3 levels, where N = 4 levels only had a 78.4%. Moreover, participants noticed this difference. They self-rated their own performance best when N = 3 on a 7-point Likert scale (1:strongly disagree - 7:strongly agree). Wilcoxon signed-rank post hoc tests showed significance, as summarized in Table 2. Therefore, we chose N = 3 as the “safe” number of discrete clench force levels that was easy for users to discriminate between."

Therefore, a user can issue a number of commands when both their hands or eyes are busy. One possible use case is when a user is riding a bicycle. Symmetric Single L1 Clench can be mapped to play/pause a music player (Click). Asymmetric Left/Right Single L1 Clench can be mapped to play the previous/next music (Discrete control). When a phone call comes in, Symmetric Single L1/2/3 clench can be mapped to accept/mute/reject an incoming phone call (Multiple Choice), and Symmetric Double L1 Clench can be used to hang up the call (Confirmation). Alternatively, clench gestures can also assist patients who may have difficulty moving their hands due to physical injuries, but retain the control of their face and mouth [13]. These gestures can be used as an assistive input method, e.g., menu selection [40], text entry [4] (Multiple Choice, Confirmation), smart home control (Click), etc. These examples show how clench gestures can improve interactions when one cannot fully use their hands or eyes."

We conducted a second user study to evaluate their performance in supporting typical tasks. We compared the clench technique with two basic input methods: dwell and single button. We conducted the study on a VR platform where three types of clench interaction patterns and three techniques could be easily implemented. In this study, we mainly investigated scenarios where users are relatively static (i.e., sitting in a chair) to obtain initial results on a VR platform. Mobile scenarios are not involved. Note that we were focused on measuring the performance of clench interaction, rather than improving the results over the baselines."

      "text": "In order to make clench interaction applicable in daily use, clench actions need to be mapped to effects with reasonable semantics. For instance, a left/right single clench makes sense when mapped to the same conceptual direction as previous/next. Designers should make sure to connect the appropriate semantic meanings with clench actions as needed. In fact, another approach for a design space evaluation could be an elicitation study where users are asked to choose the action they prefer in the design space to complete a given task. This may provide a mapping set between clench actions and effects that better reflects users’ preference on specific tasks. This can be explored in the future."

Similar to previous work, we found that fatigue greatly effects the linear relationship between EMG and clench force [31] (r 2 = 0.803,p < 0.001 from a five-minute test of three pilot users). In the future, better signal processing methods with EMG might be able to fully reflect the clench force and thus obviate an in-mouth sensor."

There are still a number of actions to be evaluated in future work, such as users’ ability to control clench asymmetrically and to use richer clenching patterns. In addition, there exist a number of potential modalities besides visual feedback. For example, Stewart et al. [30] investigated audio, and vibrotactile feedback and found that non-visual pressure input can be executed with similar speed but lower accuracy. Since clench interactions are essentially pressure-based, these modalities are worth further exploration when selection accuracy is not essential, especially in cases where visual feedback is not available."

Based on the first user study, we developed a three-dimensional - Force Level, Time and Location - design space for clench interaction and evaluated it via a questionnaire survey, whose results helped select six user-preferred clench actions. We then devised three interaction patterns for clench interaction. We conducted a second user study to measure the performance"
