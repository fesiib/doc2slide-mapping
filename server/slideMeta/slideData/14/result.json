This could be obviously used if you want a distraction, because you won't be looking at the screen, and for example, it could be used for in-pocket and set use also.  text Use-case Scenarios >Eye-free compass Direction and proximity information n, in-pocket and safe use", "And then, for discrete notifications, because now the entire phone is not vibrating, you're getting localized haptic feedback. So, it's not ambiguous and it could be used for discrete notifications.  text Use-case Scenarios >Eye-free compass Direction and proximity information Avoid distraction, in-pocket and safe use > Discrete notifications Disambiguous stimuli", "One could also have accessible features in this, not only because of the first tactile haptic feedback on the mobile phone, but also now you have tend to some of the notifications to the tactile and save on screen space for some accessible features.  text Use-case Scenarios >Eye-free compass Direction and proximity information Avoid distraction, in-pocket and safe use > Discrete notifications Disambiguous stimuli > Accessible features Save screen-space", "that using the periphery of the finger pad is a good idea for haptic feedback. And it's a new modality.  text Conclusion > Pulp Friction: A new haptic feedback modality that uses localized stimulation at the periphery of the finger-pad.", "And hopefully the prototype can be deadlocked to be deployed on our buy forum.  text Conclusion > Pulp Friction: A new haptic feedback modality that uses localized stimulation at the periphery of the finger-pad. > We proposed an evaluation prototype and reported results from an empirical experiments.", "And we gave you design space and found out that five peripheral zones for poking and vibration could be used  text Conclusion > Pulp Friction: A new haptic feedback modality that uses localized stimulation at the periphery of the finger-pad. > We proposed an evaluation prototype and reported results from an empirical experiments. > Perceive haptic feedback in up to five peripheral zones for poking and vibration; discriminate between poking and vibration; and, at least five different locomotive patterns around the finger.", "and then well, obviously, there's more information in the paper. I encourage you to read the paper.  text Conclusion > Pulp Friction: A new haptic feedback modality that uses localized stimulation at the periphery of the finger-pad. > We proposed an evaluation prototype and reported results from an empirical experiments. > Perceive haptic feedback in up to five peripheral zones for poking and vibration; discriminate between poking and vibration; and, at least five different locomotive patterns around the finger. > See paper for further design-space description, design guidelines, limitation and future work.", "(applause) - (moderator) We have time for questions, so if you have any questions, please come up. (camera shutters) - (participant) I was wondering, how did you get the outline of the hands. Like, did you capture it, or did you hard code and everything, whatever people had their hands in, and yep. And basically I was wondering if you had some kind of feedback about whether in the bowl today, actually knows about I don't know, the tension of the fingers that can actually pull it or something. - I don't know. - That's a very good question, and I missed, I forgot to mention that. So, you know, use the study. For each participant, we measured the width, fist measure, and length of the finger. Of the proximal distal, the tall part of the finger. And then we mapped it to the parameters set for each user so that it's consistent. For example, the ball that would have been used, always suggest a part that's on the weakest part. So we want to be consistent (mumbling) and because it's in a mapping system, that's something new. If it had been accurate, so as long as we can say it's got this ball throughout the center So, alternating it insures it has contact with the finger. By making it fit inside the finger. - (participant) If you were to use the bull, like, is that call hard to phone? Do you, like, everyone is holding the phone how differently? - Obviously that's a difficult one, because, we want you to know is it possible to use the periphery of the finger? Or is it impossible? Well, why doesn't (mumbling) Now, what they are trying to do, they wrote a system on the back of the form, have some kind of finger sensing and ultimately do with it what you want. - (moderator) Okay, thanks again.  text Thank You!"], "evaluationData": {"boundariesAccuracy": 0, "timeAccuracy": 0, "structureAccuracy": 0, "mappingAccuracy": 0}}
