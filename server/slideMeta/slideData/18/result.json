There are some speech and language patterns that are indicative of a young child speaking versus an adult. And, with code switching, if a voice interface is able to identify those patterns, and respond more appropriately, to the age of the person who is speaking to them, that also might help aid in resolving communication breakdowns.

communication partners and/or different communication environments [8].", " The most explicit form of code switching is to switch languages to match the language of the communication partner, such as shifting from English to Spanish [13].", " A subtle form of code-switching, in which the rules and use of language are dependent on the communication context, is demonstrated when a teenager uses a different conversational tone and different vocabulary when talking to friends than when talking to a parent.", " Pragmatics, and specifically code switching, requires some understanding and intentional thought behind communication interactions [17,35,36].", " As such, linguistic code switching often begins around ages 4-5, when children begin intentionally talking in different ways to

person who is talking needs to rephrase or say something differently because the person they were talking to did not understand what they were saying [25].", " The ability to code switch can aid in conversational repair and can be thought of as the act of adjusting your speaking style to accommodate the listener [41].", " These adjustments to speaking style can take many forms and are dependent on the communicator\u2019s language abilities.", " For example, children often use repetition as their initial repair strategy when presented with \u201cneutral\u201d clarification responses, such as

is a mechanism to guide learning through communication strategies with the intention of gradually transferring skills and responsibility to the learner [38,41].", " At an early communication stage, an example of discourse scaffolding is when a child says,", " \u201ccookie,\u201d and a parent responds with an expansion of the child\u2019s utterance: \u201cyou want more cookies.\u201d", " Dynamics between multiple communication partners, especially those involving young children, can be heavily influenced by the communicative development ages of the communication partners and the context of the communication interaction [14,18,21,24].", " Our earlier example of discourse scaffolding was appropriate for a very young child, whereas the communication interaction between a teenager and parent would look very different.", " For example, a parent might use discourse scaffolding through questioning to lead the teen to expand on their own language.", " The parent might ask, \u201cWhat did you do after school?\u201d and the teen might reply, \u201chung out with friends.\u201d The parent could then scaffold further elaboration with questions, such as, \u201cwhere did you and your friends

We see all three family members, that were present at the home at this time, coming in and collaborating to repair this communication breakdown with this voice interface. And this also relates to something our keynote speaker talked about today. Were any of here, to hear about the death dance of Jibo, the robot? Some people, yeah. It was, like, a heart breaking tale she told she told of this robot, that all of a sudden came online, and said \"you know, I'm gonna be leaving you now\", and did a little dance, and then it shut down. And died. And her comment was, \"think about who else is in the room\". They had a five year old child. And, to witness a robot, kind of doing this dance and saying well I'm going to leave you, and dying, could be a little alarming, or upsetting, to a young child. It sounded like it was alarming to the parents, as well. And the same is true with a voice interface. When you're designing a voice interface, specifically for the home environment, I think it's important to consider that there's going to be joint engagement between all of the family members who are within listening distance.  text", "And that's shown with scaffolding that we saw. But, in addition, I wanna just suggest that voice interfaces can help families with this scaffolding process. And , in fact, in our analysis of communication breakdowns, we did see, a few, positive instances, of where Alexa helped support families repair communication breakdowns. But, in this case, there were communication breakdowns on the part of Alexa not understanding. And, she gave a very specific response. For example, if I say \"Alexa, set an alarm for 10:45\". Alexa would say \"is that 10:45 in the morning, or 10:45 in the evening\"? It's a really nice way that she can give a specific response to clarify, so that she can understand her human communication partner, clearly.  text Discourse Scaffolding Specific Response", "And then, finally, I wanna return to code switching and pragmatics. Pragmatics, the SLP defined way. Of social use of language. And, when I think about multiple generations in a household, interacting with this voice interface, I think it would be really interesting. And I think possible, at a basic level, for voice interfaces to be able to understand if it is a small, young child interacting, or an adult interacting with the voice interface. There are some speech and language patterns that are indicative of a young child speaking versus an adult. And, with code switching, if a voice interface is able to identify those patterns, and respond more appropriately, to the age of the person who is speaking to them, that also might help aid in resolving communication breakdowns. For example, we did see a lot with jokes. A lot of children would asks jokes and the jokes would not be age-appropriate for that child to understand. So, code switching, is a possibility.  text", "All right. I want to wrap up by thanking Mozilla. I also really wanna thank the two Speech and Language Pathologists that helped me define and discuss these different constructs from speech and language pathology, and kind of bring it into the human-computer interaction space. Which was really nice. And, especially Teresa Fleck, who talked to me a lot about, bilingual communication, 'cause she speaks Spanish, which is very handy as well. And then thanks to the entire research team. This was a pretty intensive research study, with all 10 families, and they did so much work. And then, thanks again to our participants. And, if any of you are interested  text Acknowledgements Mozilla Teresa Fleck, MA, CCC-SLP Victoria Lai, SLP Bella Chiu, Yini Guan, Leanne Liu, Sharon Heung, Ashley Boone, Kate Yen Olivia Richards, Mingrui Zhang, Julie Kientz, Jason Yip, Alexis Hiniker", "in talking more about speech and language pathology (laughs) it's such a great topic, I think. So, I'd be really happy to talk to you about it further. Thanks! (audience applauds) - Thank you Erin, we have time for a question. And we've got one just down here.  text Erin Beneteau ebenet@uw.edu Let\u2019s talk about speech language pathology, voice interfaces and HCI!", "- Hi! (static interference) - [Jen] Hello? Oh. - Hi, now I can hear you. Uh-oh. (static interference) You know I used to always teach these courses, and my mantra was \"technology will always fail - Okay. - At some point\". - Okay so. - [Jen] Okay I think this works. So, one of the reasons why, these systems give neutral responses, is because their, the system itself is not confident of the result, right? - Mm hmm. - [Jen] And so, you have a design recommendation to, I guess, anchor on maybe some specific part of utterance. So there's, like, a little bit of this, like, tension there. So, how do you think you would kind of address that tension? I guess, a little more specifically. - Mm hmm. Well, I'm not sure. This is where I really need a computer scientist to help me. I'm not exactly sure what Alexa was encoding in that example, in the first three times, when she gave neutral responses. But, if she had just given a little bit of a clue, about anything, that would have given the family at least some context, as to what she was interpreting. So, that they could then adjust their speech and language. Does that sorta answer? Okay. - Thank you very much, Erin. - Sure. - So we're on to our final talk for this session.
