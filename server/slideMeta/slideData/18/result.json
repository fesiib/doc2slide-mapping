It was, like, a heart breaking tale she told she told of this robot, that all of a sudden came online, and said \"you know, I'm gonna be leaving you now\", and did a little dance, and then it shut down. And died. And her comment was, \"think about who else is in the room\". They had a five year old child. And, to witness a robot, kind of doing this dance and saying well I'm going to leave you, and dying, could be a little alarming, or upsetting, to a young child. It sounded like it was alarming to the parents, as well. And the same is true with a voice interface.

And I think possible, at a basic level, for voice interfaces to be able to understand if it is a small, young child interacting, or an adult interacting with the voice interface. There are some speech and language patterns that are indicative of a young child speaking versus an adult. And, with code switching, if a voice interface is able to identify those patterns, and respond more appropriately, to the age of the person who is speaking to them, that also might help aid in resolving communication breakdowns.
