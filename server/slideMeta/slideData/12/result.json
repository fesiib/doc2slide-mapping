Hello, good morning everyone. So, I'm Irni from Universiti Teknologi MARA. Today I would like to present my paper with my co-author, Corina Sas from Lancaster University on the topic of an exploration of Bitcoin mining practices, focusing on miners' trust, challenges, and motivations. So, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which unlike fiat currency is created through a process called mining. This process is conducted on blockchain technology by a distributed network miners who both collaborate and compete with each other to solve algorithm problems for validating Bitcoin transactions between anonymous parties. Mining is also called as trustless because it does not require any third party to verify transactions depending only on the consensus among miners. Mining also occurs in the absence of any central authority regarding regulating. It is decentralized as well as transparent, as any validation transaction is recorded on public ledger and can not be longer modified. For their work on validating Bitcoin transactions miners are financially rewarded. Okay here, oops, sorry.", "ocrResult": " text"}, {"index": 2, "startTime": 91.33, "endTime": 185.33, "script": "Okay, sorry. Okay. Okay here, if you can see here is an overview of Bitcoin mining practices, okay? So let's say Alice pays Bob for one Bitcoin. For this she needs the public key of Bob's wallet's address as well as the public key and private key of her wallet with address to sign the transaction. They create the transactions to be verified by full nodes, which is the machine's verified rules according to the predefined consensus rules. Once verified, the transaction is broadcasted to the memory pool, which a place that holding the pending transaction which awaits miners' validations. Miners then collect such transactions from the memory pool and put them in a block that's sized up to one megabyte. The miners compete by using the computational power by solving the blocks and produce the proof of work. The first miners who produce the quickest and longest solutions to the block's transaction is the winner which will receive the financial rewards.

(crowd applauds) - [Woman] Thank you very much, is it working? - Thank you. - [Woman] Yeah, brilliant work. Thank you very much. So I have a question regarding other kinds of blockchains. It seems that there's a difference between, well I'm always concerned that people mislead blockchain for Bitcoin blockchain, and other blockchains have different ways of operating. I wonder if you have thought about other blockchains as well, or for instance, Hyperledger, that tries to sort out the other layers of trust. - Alright, okay, thank you. Yeah, Bitcoin is the pioneer for blockchain because blockchain is created by Satoshi Nakamoto for Bitcoin cryptocurrency but today blockchain has moved beyond Bitcoin. It's more than Bitcoin. So, in this research we are focusing on Bitcoin mining, so we interviewed the Bitcoin miners. Yeah, maybe in future there should be other future works to explore other types of mining in other kind of blockchain as well. Thank you. - [Megan] Megan Knittel, Michigan State University. So in your study, you talked about how some of your participants changed from mining independently to mining in a pool or in another collective manner. I was wondering in your findings if you noticed any differences in motivations for using Bitcoin at all between the people who moved from independent mining to a pool, or stopped mining altogether. - Alright. So what I can see, the motivation of the miners when they shift from home or solo mining to the collaborative mining, the issue is because of financial. Because they need a lot of financial to maintain their machine in order for them to, to continuously mine the Bitcoin. So as the difficulty increase, some of them are not capable to proceed with the mining, so some drop off. Maybe some of them with higher capital proceed with the mining in the pool, and yeah. Thank you. - [Moderator] And I do have a question myself as well. So I'm wondering, because one of the strategies is to move the miners from actually monopolizing the whole blockchain. So how do you think miners can be encouraged, how can miners be encouraged to not monopolize? - Okay, so in our paper we have suggest to create a platform for end miners to create their own mining pool. So in a way, that is how they can encourage miners to continuously mining, yeah. - [Moderator] Awesome, thank you. - Thank you. - I'd like to thank Irni again please. - Thank you.

share of the profit\u201d [P1].", " As pointed out by one participant, data centers also need to mine in pools in order to sustain their profits: \u201cif you want to mine as an owner of a data center then you need to have large capital [\u2026] at the same time, you have to join a mining pool to make profit\u201d [P1].", " To address these challenges bitcoin data centers have started to emerge [39]: \u201cthe best option is joining the cloud mining, where you can buy a share from the owners of the data center to do the mining for you\u201d [P9].", " Compared to the home mining, data centers require much larger capital and maintenance costs.", " These include not only the cost of electricity but also of the monitoring equipment and manpower to maintain the center as illustrated in this

ensure the cabling and network are well maintained\u201d [P6].", " More than a quarter of participants valued the opportunity of data center-pool mining because of the inability to setup their own mining pool: \u201cthe difficulty today is very high and the electricity is expensive too.", " So it is not worth mining at small scale.", " I think for today, cloud mining is the best way\u201d [P13].", " In addition, leasing the mining service does not require technical expertise: \u201cdata centers offer a 3-year contract, when I get my daily profit from the hired miner [\u2026] When I joined the program, I got an ID and password to access the company website, they also give me a wallet so all profit will be straight away sent to my wallet\u201d [P20].", " Cloud mining is further

different computational power from the end miners owning their own machines at home (increasingly unprofitable), to those owning mining farms, or data centers.", " Data Center Administrators.", " The increased mining competition has demanded higher computational power.", " This has made room for data center administrators to enter the scene.", " They provided end miners the opportunity of leasing machines hosted and maintained within the data centers: \u201cmy friend owns a data center offering cloud mining service\u201d [P5].", " The data centers also join mining pools in order to increase their likelihood of successful mining, but the decision of which pool to join is made solely by the data center administrator.", " The privilege of pool administrator to distribute rewards to each entity in the pool according to the computational power brought in, cascades down to the data center administrator who further distributes such reward to the end miners within the center.", " End Miners.", " While miners engaged in solo home mining had to develop technical skills for setting and maintaining their own machines, the emergence of collective mining and of administrators supporting it, has led to end miners\u2019 deskilling.", " More than half of participants noted end miners\u2019 limited technical expertise: \u201cit is very easy: I download the software from the pool, I do the setup [\u2026] let my leased machine run for 24/7 [and] I monitor it to make sure that it doesn't crash and is connected to the internet\u201d [P10].", " End miners have limited power, as they are at the discretion of pool administrators for distributing equitable profits.", " In order to remain competitive, they also have to follow the trend set by their pool administrator for upgrading their leased machines: \u201cas a miner, we must regularly update our mining machine according to the latest chips produced by the manufacturer, to ensure we are able to maintain the reward\u201d [P6].", " The benefits of collaborative mining are offset by some important trust-related challenges.", " These pertain to the risks of mining protocol and centralization of mining practices, as well as the challenge of social trust between end miners and data centers/pool administrators.", " Risks of Mining Protocol.", " An important finding is the three challenges of the mining protocol pointed out by most of participants.", " These relate to the increased time for acquiring block confirmation, limited block size, and", " limited number of full nodes.", " Interestingly, each of these technology-related risks steams from the purposefully designed blockchain protocol.", " For instance, multiple confirmations required for recording a block was intended to limit the risk of double spending attack [6][21], but their numbers has increased from 3 to 6 leading thus to delays: \u201cthe 6 confirmations waiting time is bothering me a lot\u201d [P12], or unconfirmed blocks: \u201cthere were also cases when there was no confirmation for quite sometimes, and the bitcoins were eventually returned back [uncompleted transaction]\u201d [P19].", " The current blockchain protocol also limits the size of each block to 1MB and about half of participants expressed concerns: \u201cthis block size limits the transactions acting as a bottleneck\u201d [P18].", " This challenge has received considerable attention in security field [31], and led to increased mining\u2019s competitiveness and incentive-based fees: \u201cpeople have to increase the mining fee to give a chance to their transactions to be included in the block; however, this removes the benefit of cheap transactions\u201d [P12].", " Not at least, there is a shortage of full nodes designed to host a full copy of the blockchain: \u201cwe have about 6000 full nodes and the number is not sufficient to support the current demand\u201d [P1].", " Although critical for the decentralization of blockchain, the full nodes are resource-demanding [7], and many end miners lack the incentive to host them.", " Perceived risk in technology is one of the three factors in Corritore and colleagues\u2019 model of online trust [[23].", " Our findings point to these blockchain design features as risks, minimizing end miners\u2019 trust in the protocol, especially since they lack both control and high-level expertise needed to address them.", " Dishonest End Miners: Selfish Attacks Unconfirmed.", " A striking finding is our limited empirical evidence of selfish miners\u2019 attacks commonly discussed in security research [16][25][49][61].", " First, the majority of participants are not aware of such attacks.", " Second, for the few ones that were aware of selfish miners\u2019 attacks, two out of three participants expressed optimism: \u201cfor me, that is just a theoretical concern [because] such attack can only take place only if one has [considerable] computational power [which] I would say it is not possible\u201d [P1].", " In addition, another participant extends this argument claiming that even if selfish miners\u2019 attacks occur, they can be detected by the protocol: \u201cyes, this can happen [\u2026] but after a while, the system will know [\u2026] then the system will put the mining server to one side, so then other miners will know that they can't trust that particular mining server at this IP address\u201d [P7].", " Thus, our findings support the theoretical perspective of Bitcoin core developers, as key stakeholders in the mining process [36] on the reduced likelihood of such attacks [16][61].", " Indeed, in his original white paper [43], Nakamoto mentioned that the bitcoin network is", " secure, providing that the attacking power does not exceed the total collaborative power of the trust nodes.", " This may be different in the dystopian future suggested by two participants, where the advent of quantum computing may provide sufficient computational power to one pool for a 51% attack: \u201ccurrent computing power is too high to hack [\u2026] but with the future quantum computer [\u2026] there is a possibility that the bitcoin network will be affected\u201d [P18].", " Although mining is an anonymous practice, the machine IP is visible online, acting as a proxy for its miner.", " While selfish miners can change their machines, this is unlikely to happen often, which means that the IP offers a history of mining behavior\u2019s trustworthiness.", " This provides support for the temporal and social embeddedness as contextual properties of the framework on mechanics of trust [47].", " Centralization of Mining Practices.", " Findings indicate that mining is a highly competitive practice which requires increased investment in computational power so that miners could continue to generate profit.", " This trend is consistent with the planned scarcity of bitcoins [21].", " Figure 1 shows that the distribution of power among miners is not equal, but concentrated towards the top and middle level of the pyramid.", " Centralization is critical with respect to miners\u2019 social trust as it entails power imbalance between end miners on the one hand, and mining administrators on the other hand.", " It is also aligned with higher technical skills, so that end miners joining pools face the risk of deskilling and of lower profit distributed by the pools\u2019 and data centers\u2019 administrators.", " Centralization of mining occurs both at pool level and between pools, with larger ones contributing with a higher percentage of computational power: \u201cthere is a lot of centralization in a mining pool.", " Each of the larger pools controls like 20-30% of the contributed hash rate [to the overall blockchain].", " So miners are actually controlled by the pool that they joined\u201d [P12].", " Findings also indicate centralization by geography, with several participants acknowledging China\u2019s massive growth in miners\u2019 number [P6] and its dominance of bitcoin mining practices: \u201cit may have the authority to control the bitcoins price because of its largest bitcoin market share\u201d [P5].", " This dominance is supported by China\u2019s low-cost energy supply [62] and effective mining techniques: \u201cthey mine in a very professional way

steaming from the limited regulatory framework for sanctioning dishonest behavior: lack of audit for the distribution of rewards, the invisibility of data centers offering cloud mining, and administrators\u2019 lack of accountability.", " Lack of Audit for the Distribution of Rewards.", " The most common trust challenge of dishonest mining pools\u2019 or data centers\u2019 administrators relates to their privileged position of collecting the computational power of their end miners in order to proportionally distribute the rewards.", " Unfortunately, some administrators abuse this power, a trust issue mentioned by almost half of participants: \u201ca trust issue between miners and pool administrators may arise because the administrators are responsible for collecting all the hashing power and distributing the accurate rewards to all miners\u201d [P3].", " This challenge is due to the limited shared knowledge or audit trail of the pool\u2019s or data center\u2019s overall hash power, which in turn, allows the administrators to report inaccurately smaller profits for their end miners.", " Indeed, dishonest administrators may claim higher hashes power to attract miners to join in, but report underperformance with respect to the targeted amount of blocks, which in turn allow them to deliver unfairly smaller rewards: \u201ceach [large] pool controls like 20-30% of the hash rate and this amount is not known by the miner\u201d [P12].", " Prior work has confirmed this lack of transparency with respect to the pool\u2019s hash power [63].", " This outcome extends the value of online information for supporting website credibility [4][42] to mining pools and data centers, particularly the need for information regarding the overall computational power and transparent mechanisms for reward distribution.", " Invisibility of Data Centers.", " An interesting finding relates to the lack of visibility of the cloud computing infrastructure underpinning data centers.", "

not trivial, as findings indicate that the information provided by the data centers to support such scrutiny is limited which in turn adds to their invisibility challenge.", " Unsurprisingly,

overall, then I think it is good enough\u201d [P18].", " Through their proven history of acting in good faith, reputable major pools offer proxy indicators of reputation and motivation to preserve

Hello, good morning everyone. So, I'm Irni from Universiti Teknologi MARA. Today I would like to present my paper with my co-author, Corina Sas from Lancaster University on the topic of an exploration of Bitcoin mining practices, focusing on miners' trust, challenges, and motivations. So, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which unlike fiat currency is created through a process called mining. This process is conducted on blockchain technology by a distributed network miners who both collaborate and compete with each other to solve algorithm problems for validating Bitcoin transactions between anonymous parties. Mining is also called as trustless because it does not require any third party to verify transactions depending only on the consensus among miners. Mining also occurs in the absence of any central authority regarding regulating. It is decentralized as well as transparent, as any validation transaction is recorded on public ledger and can not be longer modified. For their work on validating Bitcoin transactions miners are financially rewarded. Okay here, oops, sorry.  text", "Okay, sorry. Okay. Okay here, if you can see here is an overview of Bitcoin mining practices, okay? So let's say Alice pays Bob for one Bitcoin. For this she needs the public key of Bob's wallet's address as well as the public key and private key of her wallet with address to sign the transaction. They create the transactions to be verified by full nodes, which is the machine's verified rules according to the predefined consensus rules. Once verified, the transaction is broadcasted to the memory pool, which a place that holding the pending transaction which awaits miners' validations. Miners then collect such transactions from the memory pool and put them in a block that's sized up to one megabyte. The miners compete by using the computational power by solving the blocks and produce the proof of work. The first miners who produce the quickest and longest solutions to the block's transaction is the winner which will receive the financial rewards.

In this research, we focus on four research questions which these are the questions targeted: miners' motivations, the blockchain's characteristics, impacting on miners' trust, how is the mining practice socially organized, and which are the trust challenges and how do miners attempt to mitigate them?  text Research Questions Which are miners\u2019 motivations for bitcoin mining? Which are blockchain\u2019s characteristics impacting on miners\u2019 trust? Which is the social organization of mining practices? Which are the main trust challenges and how do miners attempt to mitigate them?", "In order to address these research questions, we conducted interview with 20 Bitcoin miners in Malaysia between the end of 2015 until February 2016. Malaysia offers a unique opportunity for exploration Bitcoin practices in it experienced massive growth of remittance market and a growing interest in cryptocurrency. Being a developing country, Malaysia is the first to consider fintech regulations. We ask about participants motives for mining, their perceived benefit and challenges and in particular, trust issues. We also explore their perception and risk of mitigating strategies.  text Method + Interviews with 20 miners, (20 male) (mean age 30.6) + Interviews questions: \u2014 motives for bitcoin mining \u2014 benefits and challenges \u2014 trust issues related to bitcoin mining \u2014 perception of risk and mitigating strategies", "Based on interviews, we have highlighted several important findings. First is the motivation of miners. Almost half participants mentioned that they mine because of financial reward they could earn from mining. People also enjoy the limited regulation regarding the taxation of such rewards. For a few others, the motivation to mine really is due to curiosity towards the technology and desire experimenting Bitcoin mining.  text Miners\u2019 Motivation + Earning potential through fee-based rewards + Enjoying limited regulation regarding taxation of miners\u2019 rewards + Experimenting with bitcoin blockchain technology", "Findings also reveal the blockchain's supporting hindering miners' trust. First, one such factor supporting miners' trust includes the decentralized and transparent qualities for mining protocols. These are valued by participants in terms of security. Mining protocol uses cryptographic hashing algorithm to ensure that Bitcoin transaction is not fake. This supports miners' trust, in addition all miners working on the same blockchain transparently to compete with each other. Second, mining practice is mostly unregulated and not considered illegal. This limits the perceived risks of banks, governments to control mining activities. Finally, mining practice is also considered easy as it does not require advanced technical skills.  text Trust Factors * Blockchain\u2019s characteristics impacting on miners\u2019 trust \u2014 Decentralized and transparent mining protocol \u2014 Non-legally binding practice \u2014 Ease of use", "Our findings indicate three types of mining practices based on being performed individual or collectively, and own or lease machines. 16 participants started mining in 2010 to 2012 using home solo method mining individually on their computers at home. At that time, the difficulty of mining was not as high as today. Later, due to the increase of competitiveness miners needed to upgrade their machine while running and maintenance costs are also increased. Hence, four of our participants discontinued mining and the rest moving towards collaborative minings by joining home pools, while using their own machines. But still using their own machines. The profit was divided according to the amount of power which each miner contributed to the pool. Again, due to the fact of increase in cost, in particular those for continual upgrading of the machine, 12 of our participants discontinued mining. The remaining four moved towards collective mining on leased machines. One of them owned a data center while the other three participants started mining on leased machine in the data center for cloud mining.  text \u2122 Miners\u2019 Social Organisation + Social organization of mining practice: competitiveness Individual Colle \u2018Own machines", "Finding indicate three types of miners. One is the mining pool administrator, who facilitates miners' access to mining pool. This type of miners has advanced skill to set up, run and maintain the machine within the pools. The other type of data center administrator who provide end miners opportunity of leasing machine hosted and maintain their data centers. Finally, we have end miners who can have limited skills, even lower those required for home solos. This is because they merely pay for leasing a machine in larger pool. Hence, we can see a serious continual deskilling of miners as they move towards collective mining. Also, in contrast with pool administrator, end miners have limited power, and in order to remain competitive, they have to follow the trends set by their pool administrator. For example, continually increase the leasing fees for demand upgrading machines to ensure the competitiveness.  text \u2122 Pyramid of Types of Miners End miners", "There are several trust challenges of collaborative mining. First, from the technical perspective we can see there is a risk of mining protocol. This relates time required for recording the new block. This is because current practice is to wait not three as before, but six confirmation to register a block, which leads to delay. This is also limiting block size, as each block have to hold up to one megabyte of transactions. With larger volume of transactions, the bottleneck issue contributes to increased competitiveness and increased miners' fees. From social perspective, collective miners leads to centralization and issues to end miners' distrust in mining administrators. This are due to the lack of the audit for distribution rewards in pool. The invisibility of data centers, some being exclusively in the cloud with no information on their physical presence. Findings indicates two strategies of end miners  text ollaborative Mining: Challenges Risk of mining protocol: increased number of block confirmations, limited block size Centralization of mining practices: end miners\u2019 distrust in mining administrators \u2014 lack of audit for the distribution of rewards \u2014 invisibility of data centers", "mitigating challenges of collaborative mining.  text ollaborative Mining: Challenges Mitigating such challenges: \u2014 selecting reputable major pools \u2014 decentralizing collaborative mining", "In order to reflect on the theoretical implications of our findings, we apply the Bitcoin transferring work consisting three layers of trust and their stakeholders, and refine them prospective of Bitcoin miners. Thus, with respect to institutional trust, miners distrust financial and government institution. But, the unregulation of mining practices mitigates their perceived risk of abuse of power. With respect to social trust, outcomes suggest that the main challenge is not among the end miners due to the mining protocol, but between the end miners and the dishonest pools also the data center administrator. This is the most problematic layers of trust. Our finding also indicate that the purpose for design decentralization unregulation features strengthen the miners' technological trust in blockchain. And this is the least problematic layers of trust.  text Theoretical Implications Model of trust among bitcoin miners \u2014 Bitcoin trust framework (Sas and Khairuddin, 2015", "Despite decentralization being a key principal of blockchain, findings show a strong tendency toward the centralization of mining practices.

(crowd applauds) - [Woman] Thank you very much, is it working? - Thank you. - [Woman] Yeah, brilliant work. Thank you very much. So I have a question regarding other kinds of blockchains. It seems that there's a difference between, well I'm always concerned that people mislead blockchain for Bitcoin blockchain, and other blockchains have different ways of operating. I wonder if you have thought about other blockchains as well, or for instance, Hyperledger, that tries to sort out the other layers of trust. - Alright, okay, thank you. Yeah, Bitcoin is the pioneer for blockchain because blockchain is created by Satoshi Nakamoto for Bitcoin cryptocurrency but today blockchain has moved beyond Bitcoin. It's more than Bitcoin. So, in this research we are focusing on Bitcoin mining, so we interviewed the Bitcoin miners. Yeah, maybe in future there should be other future works to explore other types of mining in other kind of blockchain as well. Thank you. - [Megan] Megan Knittel, Michigan State University. So in your study, you talked about how some of your participants changed from mining independently to mining in a pool or in another collective manner. I was wondering in your findings if you noticed any differences in motivations for using Bitcoin at all between the people who moved from independent mining to a pool, or stopped mining altogether. - Alright. So what I can see, the motivation of the miners when they shift from home or solo mining to the collaborative mining, the issue is because of financial. Because they need a lot of financial to maintain their machine in order for them to, to continuously mine the Bitcoin. So as the difficulty increase, some of them are not capable to proceed with the mining, so some drop off. Maybe some of them with higher capital proceed with the mining in the pool, and yeah. Thank you. - [Moderator] And I do have a question myself as well. So I'm wondering, because one of the strategies is to move the miners from actually monopolizing the whole blockchain. So how do you think miners can be encouraged, how can miners be encouraged to not monopolize? - Okay, so in our paper we have suggest to create a platform for end miners to create their own mining pool. So in a way, that is how they can encourage miners to continuously mining, yeah. - [Moderator] Awesome, thank you. - Thank you. - I'd like to thank Irni again please. - Thank you.
