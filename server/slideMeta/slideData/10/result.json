But that shared experience really provided that setting within which meaningful interactions happened. So social media news feed algorithms should take into account that even though sharing sensitive information is challenging, a lot of times when people do take that step to talk about their experiences online, they look for, and need, helpful interactions. And such interactions can originate from various kinds of ties, through different communication channels. And, as such, showing content to only one's what a platform would assume are closer ties, traditionally, or with whom one interacts more frequently, may not necessarily be the best approach to designing newsfeed algorithms if we want to promote connections that are meaningful to people, particularly in times of personal distress.", "ocrResult": " text Takeaways Pen eee Con identified social media can lead to \u2018outcomes on three levels: individu ears Cm eat) stem from diverse ties with various eke ce ne ey variety of communication channels Ree eae ree eee eee ace OMe network of known ties-related outcomes Cement mes Perens Etat) econ"}, {"index": 22, "startTime": 886.0, "endTime": 1351.33, "script": "And finally, I argue that both connectivity within and separation from networks of known ties are key in designing social media sites to foster beneficial disclosures of self, and social support exchange in stigmatized contexts. Prior work establishes that anonymity is an important feature in designing online spaces for seeking support and disclosing experiences that are stigmatized. Prior work has also shown that sometimes disclosures on more anonymous settings can then help people to feel more comfortable to talk about their experiences in a more identified setting. Prior work also shows that people use several social media platforms to separate networks of known ties from other ties that they might not actually even know in person, who may better understand what they are going through, especially during life transitions. My findings complicate these insights from prior work by showing how even becoming aware that similar others even exist within one's network of known ties, identifying them, and connecting with them is also very powerful for individuals experiencing distress and stigma. And I suggest that social media site designs should leverage the power of connectivity including among similar others within networks of known ties, and the need for privacy, separation, and anonymity. And with that, this was a solo-authored paper, but I collected the data that I used to analyze this work when I was a student with Andrea Forte, and obviously this work would not have been possible without the support and trust from the participants who helped me learn from their experiences, and folks who provided support and encouragement and feedback on earlier versions of this work. And with that, I'm happy to take questions now. (audience applause) - If you have a question, if you could raise your hand clearly, that would be-- oh, we have a question over here on the left. - [Audience Member] Hello? I was wondering if you could talk a little bit-- - Where are you? - [Audience Member] Oh, I'm down here, hi. Sorry, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, to your last point there, how people sort of chose their audiences or discovered them on identified social media? Because I could imagine that even within a large friend network, on identified social media you would have people who might stigmatize a disclosure. So did you find it was kind of like private messages, or? - There's some echo, could you maybe? - [Audience Member] Yeah, is this better? - A little bit better, yeah. - [Audience Member] Okay, do you want me to start over? - Yes, could you just repeat the question again? - [Audience Member] Sure. Mostly just asking about how people identified their audiences, and yeah, kind of chose their audiences on social media. - Yeah, so the way that people thought about whom to share with, and how, and why, and why not, that's a separate piece of work that I've published at CHI 2018, but in general, there's a lot of complexity that goes into who people decide to share with, and it largely depends on the goals and the motivations that people have for sharing. So for example, and I discuss in that other paper, if someone wants the news to be known because, let's say, they had announced that they were pregnant, and then now they don't want to engage in specific kinds of follow-up questions and that kind of thing, then that's a big reason for people to then engage in disclosing so the audience in that sense ideally would be large and a very efficient way. Other times, people want to engage in interactions with people who might be able to gather signals in ways that are more indirect and vague, for example, those different kinds of expressions that are not necessarily, \"Hey I experienced this,\" but rather more indirect. I'm happy to chat later about that other work. - [Moderator] I should say as well, if you could say your name and your affiliation before you ask the question, that would be great. And we have one more question, got time for one more question just there. - Moira had her hand up. - [Audience Member] Hi Naz, this is Moira Burke from Facebook. This is great work, thank you. I'm wondering if your participants talked about the different kinds of responses they got when they shared with their personal networks verus in a Facebook group? Are Facebook groups are generic Baby Center? - Yes. Yes, happy to talk about that. So, there were different kinds of responses that people got. In a personal Facebook space, there were comments around, kind of generic comments like, \"sorry for your loss,\" nothing more intimate or personal, which are also helpful more most people, but some people though that they were not super helpful or intimate. There were also other kinds of comments where more around, \"me too, I get what you're going through,\" and kind of reciprocations. But there were also other kinds of more intimate connections that followed up, people followed up in private messages, or other kinds of text messages, phone calls even, sometimes from closer ties. But Facebook Messenger was actually interesting in that it wasn't necessarily the case that people who were necessarily close to this person felt that they could private message, when the shared experience really met that bar for people to be like, \"no, I really need to talk to this person.\" Whereas on more specific support spaces like Facebook groups, or Sub-Reddits and such, it was a lot of, people largely used those for informational needs a lot of times, but also emotional support where some people feel more comfortable to only talk to others whom they know that have their shared experience. But what's interesting here is that once people take that step to talk about their experiences to their networks outside of these separate spaces, then a lot of disclosures follow from other people in response to them and also not necessarily even in response to them. So I've had participants talk about how they've shared about their experiences because someone else posted about their experience. And then they decided to, separately, on their own Facebook profile, talk about their experience. - [Moderator] Thank you very much, Naz. - Yep, you're welcome, thank you.", "ocrResult": " text Takeaways CeCe ee eee Con identified social media can lead to rere ee er ee een eens Cay stem from diverse ties with various pee ce ey variety of communication channels Ree ener Relationship-related outcomes, some eee eee OMe network of known ties-related outcomes Oem onae eee eerie Ect) Coe cos Both connectivity within and separation from networks of known ties are key in Pee ots beneficial disclosures & social support See ca"}, {"index": 23, "startTime": 1352.0, "endTime": 1355.33, "script": "(audience applause)", "ocrResult": " text"}], "outline": [{"section": "1 INTRODUCTION", "startSlideIndex": 0, "endSlideIndex": 11}, {"section": "4.2.4 R: Increased awareness about the stigma associated with", "startSlideIndex": 12, "endSlideIndex": 17}, {"section": "4.3 Dyad-Level Outcomes", "startSlideIndex": 18, "endSlideIndex": 23}]}
