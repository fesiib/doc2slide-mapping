But that shared experience really provided that setting within which meaningful interactions happened. So social media news feed algorithms should take into account that even though sharing sensitive information is challenging, a lot of times when people do take that step to talk about their experiences online, they look for, and need, helpful interactions. And such interactions can originate from various kinds of ties, through different communication channels. And, as such, showing content to only one's what a platform would assume are closer ties, traditionally, or with whom one interacts more frequently, may not necessarily be the best approach to designing newsfeed algorithms if we want to promote connections that are meaningful to people, particularly in times of personal distress.", "ocrResult": " text Takeaways Pen eee Con identified social media can lead to \u2018outcomes on three levels: individu ears Cm eat) stem from diverse ties with various eke ce ne ey variety of communication channels Ree eae ree eee eee ace OMe network of known ties-related outcomes Cement mes Perens Etat) econ"}, {"index": 22, "startTime": 886.0, "endTime": 1351.33, "script": "And finally, I argue that both connectivity within and separation from networks of known ties are key in designing social media sites to foster beneficial disclosures of self, and social support exchange in stigmatized contexts. Prior work establishes that anonymity is an important feature in designing online spaces for seeking support and disclosing experiences that are stigmatized. Prior work has also shown that sometimes disclosures on more anonymous settings can then help people to feel more comfortable to talk about their experiences in a more identified setting. Prior work also shows that people use several social media platforms to separate networks of known ties from other ties that they might not actually even know in person, who may better understand what they are going through, especially during life transitions. My findings complicate these insights from prior work by showing how even becoming aware that similar others even exist within one's network of known ties, identifying them, and connecting with them is also very powerful for individuals experiencing distress and stigma. And I suggest that social media site designs should leverage the power of connectivity including among similar others within networks of known ties, and the need for privacy, separation, and anonymity. And with that, this was a solo-authored paper, but I collected the data that I used to analyze this work when I was a student with Andrea Forte, and obviously this work would not have been possible without the support and trust from the participants who helped me learn from their experiences, and folks who provided support and encouragement and feedback on earlier versions of this work. And with that, I'm happy to take questions now. (audience applause) - If you have a question, if you could raise your hand clearly, that would be-- oh, we have a question over here on the left. - [Audience Member] Hello? I was wondering if you could talk a little bit-- - Where are you? - [Audience Member] Oh, I'm down here, hi. Sorry, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, to your last point there, how people sort of chose their audiences or discovered them on identified social media? Because I could imagine that even within a large friend network, on identified social media you would have people who might stigmatize a disclosure. So did you find it was kind of like private messages, or? - There's some echo, could you maybe? - [Audience Member] Yeah, is this better? - A little bit better, yeah. - [Audience Member] Okay, do you want me to start over? - Yes, could you just repeat the question again? - [Audience Member] Sure. Mostly just asking about how people identified their audiences, and yeah, kind of chose their audiences on social media. - Yeah, so the way that people thought about whom to share with, and how, and why, and why not, that's a separate piece of work that I've published at CHI 2018, but in general, there's a lot of complexity that goes into who people decide to share with, and it largely depends on the goals and the motivations that people have for sharing. So for example, and I discuss in that other paper, if someone wants the news to be known because, let's say, they had announced that they were pregnant, and then now they don't want to engage in specific kinds of follow-up questions and that kind of thing, then that's a big reason for people to then engage in disclosing so the audience in that sense ideally would be large and a very efficient way. Other times, people want to engage in interactions with people who might be able to gather signals in ways that are more indirect and vague, for example, those different kinds of expressions that are not necessarily, \"Hey I experienced this,\" but rather more indirect. I'm happy to chat later about that other work. - [Moderator] I should say as well, if you could say your name and your affiliation before you ask the question, that would be great. And we have one more question, got time for one more question just there. - Moira had her hand up. - [Audience Member] Hi Naz, this is Moira Burke from Facebook. This is great work, thank you. I'm wondering if your participants talked about the different kinds of responses they got when they shared with their personal networks verus in a Facebook group? Are Facebook groups are generic Baby Center? - Yes. Yes, happy to talk about that. So, there were different kinds of responses that people got. In a personal Facebook space, there were comments around, kind of generic comments like, \"sorry for your loss,\" nothing more intimate or personal, which are also helpful more most people, but some people though that they were not super helpful or intimate. There were also other kinds of comments where more around, \"me too, I get what you're going through,\" and kind of reciprocations. But there were also other kinds of more intimate connections that followed up, people followed up in private messages, or other kinds of text messages, phone calls even, sometimes from closer ties. But Facebook Messenger was actually interesting in that it wasn't necessarily the case that people who were necessarily close to this person felt that they could private message, when the shared experience really met that bar for people to be like, \"no, I really need to talk to this person.\" Whereas on more specific support spaces like Facebook groups, or Sub-Reddits and such, it was a lot of, people largely used those for informational needs a lot of times, but also emotional support where some people feel more comfortable to only talk to others whom they know that have their shared experience. But what's interesting here is that once people take that step to talk about their experiences to their networks outside of these separate spaces, then a lot of disclosures follow from other people in response to them and also not necessarily even in response to them. So I've had participants talk about how they've shared about their experiences because someone else posted about their experience. And then they decided to, separately, on their own Facebook profile, talk about their experience. - [Moderator] Thank you very much, Naz. - Yep, you're welcome, thank you.", "ocrResult": " text

is motivated and inspired by a disclosure by someone else in their network, and as a result of reduced stigma perception [5].", " For example, P2 shared how a friend of hers posted about her loss experience inspired by P2\u2019s disclosure, and as a result of reduced perceived stigma due to P2\u2019s post: \u201cIt made me feel really good because she said that I had inspired her to share.", " I kept talking about taking the stigma away from the conversation because it\u2019s important that we are able to support each other and it\u2019s a big deal, and not being able to talk about it just hurts more.", " She\u2019d put all of that to her post as well, so it did make me feel really good that I was actually helping someone.", " . .", " It made me feel good that I was able to have that

outcomes as perceived by individuals who perform disclosures.", " 4.1.2 R: Facilitate reciprocal disclosures in response to disclosures.", " Facilitating reciprocal disclosures in response to the poster was both a common disclosure response received by, and outcome perceived by participants.", " While reciprocal disclosures in response to participants\u2019 disclosures were a perceived disclosure outcome in and of themselves, participants remarked that these reciprocations led to other outcomes in turn.", " These reciprocations occurred through a variety of communication channels including one-to-many comments, private one-on-one electronic channels (e.g., private messages, text messages, emails), or in-person.", " They also originated from various kinds of ties, strong and

a miscarriage and maybe one or two of them have publicly shared that they\u2019ve gone through it and they want to be a voice and not be silence.", " It\u2019s hard to be that first person to stand up and say, \u2018This is what I\u2019ve gone through.\u2019 It\u2019s easier for everyone to follow.\u201d To describe reciprocations, P25 said: \u201cI got flooded with, \u2018Oh, I had a miscarriage, too.\u2019 \u201d Participants also described reciprocal disclosures occurring through different communication channels with various privacy levels.", " As P25 put it: \u201cThere was a lot of comments, and a lot of people, they were like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m sorry.", " This happened to us, too,\u2019 in the comment section.", " Then, what I was getting was a lot of private messages and a lot of offline emails.", " Non-Facebook, non-social media emails, texts, and calls based on, stemming from the Facebook post.\u201d", " Comparing different communicationmodes, P20 said: \u201cSome people didn\u2019t want other people to know that they had gone through the same thing so they sent me a private message and some people put it out there that they had.\u201d While some remarked that private messages allowed the reciprocator to manage their privacy better (compared to public reciprocations through a comment), some believed private messages were more personal and meaningful.", " For example, P12 said: \u201cI thought it\u2019s probably a little easier to get personal through a private message.", " Some of them I think even just started out with something really simple,

experiences.", " . .", " Some people had different ways of reaching out too.", " Then I guess some people too, prompted by the Facebook post, would send an email or a text, rather than use the", "

normalize miscarriages, to let you know that you\u2019re not alone, and like I said, to share something about themselves or something to help you to feel better.\u201d Similarly, P10 said: \u201cPeople don\u2019t talk about it until, I think, you have an avenue where you can relate, then you go down there, and you can say, \u2018Okay, I can ping you, and we can be part of this group together.\u2019 Basically I was left hanging in the wind for a little bit, and so many women, I have to imagine, are left hanging in the wind about this, thinking this is so abnormal, and this is so weird, as opposed to no, this is actually really, really common.\u201d Reciprocations also made participants feel as though it was more appropriate to talk about pregnancy loss than they had originally thought.", " For example, P15 said: \u201cI guess it made me feel less alone and it made me feel less inappropriate for sharing the information with them because they are like, \u2018I know about this as well it\u2019s not just some weird unsolicited story that you are sharing with me.", " It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve experienced too.\u2019 \u201d This perceived

relevant topics.", " Participants remarked that their disclosures impacted some members of their social networks\u2019 opinions and attitudes.", " For example, P13 shared how her aunt had an opinion

couple of people that said that they had experienced a loss too and will light a candle for both my loss and theirs on this special night or whatever.\u201d", " Social media disclosures also led to

just needed to talk to somebody, or really I think she offered anything that we needed.", " A lot of people make that offer in time of need, but don\u2019t necessarily maybe mean it when you actually then follow through.", " I ended up mostly through text messaging, but she really was helpful.", " I think out of all the people who contacted me, probably the most.", " Some people brought meals over.", " A lot of people said, \u2018What can we do?\u2019 At that point there really wasn\u2019t anything we needed, but I think a lot of people show their support and love through baking and cooking food.\u201d Such instrumental and continuous support was uniquely helpful for participants.", " Participants found caring reactions from non-traditionally close ties to be uniquely

But that shared experience really provided that setting within which meaningful interactions happened. So social media news feed algorithms should take into account that even though sharing sensitive information is challenging, a lot of times when people do take that step to talk about their experiences online, they look for, and need, helpful interactions. And such interactions can originate from various kinds of ties, through different communication channels. And, as such, showing content to only one's what a platform would assume are closer ties, traditionally, or with whom one interacts more frequently, may not necessarily be the best approach to designing newsfeed algorithms if we want to promote connections that are meaningful to people, particularly in times of personal distress.  text Takeaways Pen eee Con identified social media can lead to \u2018outcomes on three levels: individu ears Cm eat) stem from diverse ties with various eke ce ne ey variety of communication channels Ree eae ree eee eee ace OMe network of known ties-related outcomes Cement mes Perens Etat) econ", "And finally, I argue that both connectivity within and separation from networks of known ties are key in designing social media sites to foster beneficial disclosures of self, and social support exchange in stigmatized contexts. Prior work establishes that anonymity is an important feature in designing online spaces for seeking support and disclosing experiences that are stigmatized. Prior work has also shown that sometimes disclosures on more anonymous settings can then help people to feel more comfortable to talk about their experiences in a more identified setting. Prior work also shows that people use several social media platforms to separate networks of known ties from other ties that they might not actually even know in person, who may better understand what they are going through, especially during life transitions. My findings complicate these insights from prior work by showing how even becoming aware that similar others even exist within one's network of known ties, identifying them, and connecting with them is also very powerful for individuals experiencing distress and stigma. And I suggest that social media site designs should leverage the power of connectivity including among similar others within networks of known ties, and the need for privacy, separation, and anonymity. And with that, this was a solo-authored paper, but I collected the data that I used to analyze this work when I was a student with Andrea Forte, and obviously this work would not have been possible without the support and trust from the participants who helped me learn from their experiences, and folks who provided support and encouragement and feedback on earlier versions of this work. And with that, I'm happy to take questions now. (audience applause) - If you have a question, if you could raise your hand clearly, that would be-- oh, we have a question over here on the left. - [Audience Member] Hello? I was wondering if you could talk a little bit-- - Where are you? - [Audience Member] Oh, I'm down here, hi. Sorry, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, to your last point there, how people sort of chose their audiences or discovered them on identified social media? Because I could imagine that even within a large friend network, on identified social media you would have people who might stigmatize a disclosure. So did you find it was kind of like private messages, or? - There's some echo, could you maybe? - [Audience Member] Yeah, is this better? - A little bit better, yeah. - [Audience Member] Okay, do you want me to start over? - Yes, could you just repeat the question again? - [Audience Member] Sure. Mostly just asking about how people identified their audiences, and yeah, kind of chose their audiences on social media. - Yeah, so the way that people thought about whom to share with, and how, and why, and why not, that's a separate piece of work that I've published at CHI 2018, but in general, there's a lot of complexity that goes into who people decide to share with, and it largely depends on the goals and the motivations that people have for sharing. So for example, and I discuss in that other paper, if someone wants the news to be known because, let's say, they had announced that they were pregnant, and then now they don't want to engage in specific kinds of follow-up questions and that kind of thing, then that's a big reason for people to then engage in disclosing so the audience in that sense ideally would be large and a very efficient way. Other times, people want to engage in interactions with people who might be able to gather signals in ways that are more indirect and vague, for example, those different kinds of expressions that are not necessarily, \"Hey I experienced this,\" but rather more indirect. I'm happy to chat later about that other work. - [Moderator] I should say as well, if you could say your name and your affiliation before you ask the question, that would be great. And we have one more question, got time for one more question just there. - Moira had her hand up. - [Audience Member] Hi Naz, this is Moira Burke from Facebook. This is great work, thank you. I'm wondering if your participants talked about the different kinds of responses they got when they shared with their personal networks verus in a Facebook group? Are Facebook groups are generic Baby Center? - Yes. Yes, happy to talk about that. So, there were different kinds of responses that people got. In a personal Facebook space, there were comments around, kind of generic comments like, \"sorry for your loss,\" nothing more intimate or personal, which are also helpful more most people, but some people though that they were not super helpful or intimate. There were also other kinds of comments where more around, \"me too, I get what you're going through,\" and kind of reciprocations. But there were also other kinds of more intimate connections that followed up, people followed up in private messages, or other kinds of text messages, phone calls even, sometimes from closer ties. But Facebook Messenger was actually interesting in that it wasn't necessarily the case that people who were necessarily close to this person felt that they could private message, when the shared experience really met that bar for people to be like, \"no, I really need to talk to this person.\" Whereas on more specific support spaces like Facebook groups, or Sub-Reddits and such, it was a lot of, people largely used those for informational needs a lot of times, but also emotional support where some people feel more comfortable to only talk to others whom they know that have their shared experience. But what's interesting here is that once people take that step to talk about their experiences to their networks outside of these separate spaces, then a lot of disclosures follow from other people in response to them and also not necessarily even in response to them. So I've had participants talk about how they've shared about their experiences because someone else posted about their experience. And then they decided to, separately, on their own Facebook profile, talk about their experience. - [Moderator] Thank you very much, Naz. - Yep, you're welcome, thank you.  text Takeaways CeCe ee eee Con identified social media can lead to rere ee er ee een eens Cay stem from diverse ties with various pee ce ey variety of communication channels Ree ener Relationship-related outcomes, some eee eee OMe network of known ties-related outcomes Oem onae eee eerie Ect) Coe cos Both connectivity within and separation from networks of known ties are key in Pee ots beneficial disclosures & social support See ca", "(audience applause)  text"], "evaluationData": {"boundariesAccuracy": 0, "timeAccuracy": 0, "structureAccuracy": 0, "mappingAccuracy": 0}}
