The recording, the video recording, that we have, like what was the process looking like there with oh the gain, and this and that? - Right, so we kept the kinda of instructions a little bit vague so these are the instructions, these are the only instructions they really got. So it was to adjust move closer or adjust re-orient the microphone. It doesn't tell them what direction to re-orient it. Partly because there's no way to, like, say that outright in any use case. Like, you do this or that, right? 'Cause you know, we don't know how it's gonna be, if we deploy this, which way their microphone is going to be pointing. So giving kind of specific advice can be more difficult. It's definitely a topic of future work that we're doing stuff. And they got the same instructions in the base line condition. What we noticed, if you look at the videos, is that people just didn't experiment in the control condition at all. Like, these are people that we brought in, too, so they were definitely participating in the test but they really just didn't know what to do, they just kind of fiddled around the environment. But they didn't know what direction to go in or how to alter things to make things sound better and stuff like that. - [Chelsea] So was the woman in the video kind of looking at these colors and-- - Yeah. - [Chelsea] Okay, all Right. - Yeah she's looking down at a lap top while she's playing around with the environment and stuff like that. - [Chelsea] Awesome, thank you! - Unfortunately, we need to switch to the next speaker.", "ocrResult": " text Conclusion VoiceAssist is an effective interface imp preferred VoiceAssist recordings ist did not notice an improvement with"}, {"index": 29, "startTime": 1214.67, "endTime": 60.83, "script": "", "ocrResult": " text"}], "outline": [{"section": "", "startSlideIndex": 0, "endSlideIndex": 3}, {"section": "1 INTRODUCTION", "startSlideIndex": 4, "endSlideIndex": 9}, {"section": "Interface", "startSlideIndex": 10, "endSlideIndex": 15}, {"section": "Procedure", "startSlideIndex": 16, "endSlideIndex": 23}, {"section": "Self-reported evaluation", "startSlideIndex": 24, "endSlideIndex": 29}]}
