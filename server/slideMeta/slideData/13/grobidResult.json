Newcomers to voice recording often make mistakes when recording their voice, leading to a poor recording. High recording quality is a hallmark of successful voice-based media (e.g. radio broadcast such as NPR or popular podcasts and YouTube channels). Two key problems in many amateur recordings of poor quality are bad room acoustics (reverberation), and too much background noise (e.g. fans, electronics, street noise). LibriVox -a site where volunteers record audio books -has sections in their contributor guide on avoiding \"room echo\" and \"background noise\", illustrating how common these problems are. Denoising and dereverberation of recorded speech are entire fields of study because they are such common problems in speech recordings [11,12].\nA common workflow in voice recording is to record a \"take\" and then apply audio enhancement tools to the recording to improve its quality (post-processing of the recording). Denoising tools are used to reduce unwanted background noise. Dereverberation tools are used to reduce the effect of a room and echos within the room. However, the output of these tools is imperfect, with noticeable distortions and artifacts on the resultant audio [19]. Therefore, to get high-quality Figure 1: VoiceAssist, a system that displays visual feedback on audio quality in order to help users create high-quality voice recordings. We display two quality measures, which are indicated by a color gradient ranging from red (poor quality) to green, (high quality). In this recording, there is little background noise but the room acoustics are poor. The user can make adjustments and respond to the visual feedback to improve audio quality.\nvoice recordings, we think it is beneficial to simply record the audio with less noise and reverberation in the first place. When a professional recording engineer and recording studio are available, the engineer provides feedback and guidance on microphone placement and recording technique, resulting in a high-quality recording with little need for denoising or dereverberation. For many applications, however, a recording engineer and studio may not be practical or readily available. People may wish to record late at night, in their home, or without prior scheduling. The nature of the project may not allow for the expense of a recording engineer and studio.\nVoiceAssist (Figure 1) helps inexperienced users produce high quality recordings by providing real-time visual feedback on the quality of the recording, like an expert recording engineer would. This is opposed to traditional recording software, which does not provide visual feedback on sound quality. Traditional recording software usually only provides volume or frequency information (e.g. Adobe Audition or Audacity). Our system helps the user find the \"sweet spot\" of the microphone 1 -the optimal area within the microphone's pickup pattern for recording. The feedback from our system simulates part of the expertise a recording engineer would bring to the recording session. Our work integrates audio quality measures directly into an interactive human-machine loop to maximize audio quality at capture-time. We demonstrate the utility of this feedback for creating high-quality voice recordings. We compare VoiceAssist (Figure 1) to a traditional recording interface (Figure 3). We show that users, when presented with visual feedback about audio quality, produce higher-quality voice recordings.\n1 https://www.voices.com/blog/microphone_sweet_spot 2 RELATED WORK Active Capture [6] is a paradigm for media production that combines capture, interaction, and processing. Active capture systems use an iteration loop between the human and the machine to improve the quality of produced media. They aim to reduce the amount of effort required to produce highquality media. These systems have been used to help people create better videos and photos by guiding them using automated quality feedback towards better framing [5,7] or better vantage points [15]. For example, NudgeCam [3] helps users record interviews that follow good practices, such as ensuring the interviewee is framed correctly. VoiceAssist is an analogous system for improving sound quality.\nPresentation Sensei [10] uses speech and image processing techniques to provide capture-time feedback on the way the person presents themselves: amount of eye contact with the camera, speech speed and pitch. Narration Coach [17] also provides feedback on a number of measures that affect speech performance quality. The feedback is focused on speech performance characteristics, such as emphasis, variety, flow, and diction. In their system, the user first records speech and then edits their recording using the feedback. The user than records the speech again, using the edited recording as a guide. The iterative process leads to a better speech performance. These systems focus on the performance quality of the text rather than the sound quality.\nSpeech enhancement. Users often follow a post-processing paradigm where they record the audio and then edit the recording using audio enhancement tools such as denoisers and dereverberators. However, speech enhancement tools [1,13,14] either often leave behind audible artifacts or only work in a limited set of cases. We aim to help users make recordings with higher sound quality that do not need post-processing.\nAudio quality measures. There are several automated speech audio quality measures such as PESQ [16], PEAQ [22], and STOI [21]. We use two measures in this work -the speech transmission index (STI) [8] and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) [20]. A few methods have been developed to estimate audio quality directly from speech audio without comparing it to a reference \"clean\" recording [18,23,23,24]. None of these methods have been incorporated into a realtime recording interface. VoiceAssist integrates two of these algorithms into a system for improving recording quality at capture-time.", "n_publication_ref": 22, "n_figure_ref": 4}, {"heading": "VOICEASSIST", "text": "Our system analyzes the audio quality of a user's recording in real-time.

These boxes change color on a gradient that goes from red (poor audio quality) to green (excellent audio quality). Below the two boxes is the traditional volume-based visual feedback.\nPilot studies revealed that a simple feedback mechanism (colored box) was important. An earlier version of our interface (shown in Figure 2) used a more traditional timeseries representation to indicate audio quality. Users in the pilot study reported that monitoring the two objective metrics (room acoustics and background noise) when represented as a time-series while also reading a prepared text (a common recording scenario) was difficult. This was possibly because the time-series representation has a very active visual footprint, distracting from the task of recording a prepared text. When the time-series representation was substituted for simple colored boxes, users were able to keep track of the audio quality in their peripheral vision while still being able to focus on the text.\nWe considered other visualizations as well, such as a speed meter style visualization, reporting the raw quality numbers, and happy/sad emoji visualization. We settled on the final design because it provides intuitive situational awareness and is easily grasped with peripheral vision. Finally, we chose a red/green colormap which does not work for those with color blindness. This could be addressed by adjusting the colormap.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "Room acoustics quality", "text": "When recording speech in a room, the sound waves reach the microphone directly and also indirectly via reflections off of the walls and other surfaces in the room. The effect that these reflections have on the recording have to do with the room acoustics. The reflections are called the indirect sound and the speech is called the direct sound. The quality of a recording is strongly influenced by the ratio between the direct and indirect sound. The size of and material of the surfaces in the room have an effect on this, as well as the relative positions of the speaker and the microphone. If the user is close to the microphone and is speaking inside the microphone's pick-up region (e.g. into the correct side of the microphone, rather than the side or rear of the mic), the direct sound will dominate the indirect sound, resulting in better recording quality.\nThe speech transmission index (STI) measures the effect a recording environment has on a recording [2]. Specifically, it measures how the recording environment warps the modulations of speech at frequencies that are important to speech perception. STI ranges between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the room has distorted the speech to noise and 1 indicates that the room has no effect on the speech. STIs above .75 are considered usable for public address systems, while STIs above .95 are found in professionally recorded speech. STI measurement typically requires specialized sound sources, equipment, and access to the recording environment. Our use case requires a low-effort and real-time approach to STI measurement so that the user can find the optimal recording setup quickly. For our purposes, we need to be able to measure the STI of a recording from the voice recording in real-time.\nWe use a method for estimating STI from speech via a convolutional neural network [18]. The network is trained with a synthetic dataset of reverberant speech with known STI values for each example in the dataset. The input to the network is 1 second of reverberant speech. The output of the network is the corresponding STI for the impulse response used to produce the reverberant speech. The trained network reliably predicts the speech transmission index from reverberant speech. It is a small network with 40000 parameters, making it suitable for real-time applications.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Background noise", "text": "Audio quality can also be affected by the amount of background noise in the recording. Not turning off background noise sources (e.g. air conditioners or fans or other appliances) or placing the mic too close or pointing towards a noise source are very common mistakes for amateurs. These mistakes result in a recording with a low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The SNR is computed by dividing the power of the signal (speech) by the power of the noise. Professional voice recordings will generally have very high SNR.\nTo measure the signal to noise ratio, we first need to identify which parts of the recording are speech and which are noise. We use a state-of-the-art voice activity detector provided in the WebRTC [9] package to do this. We run the voice activity detector on the recording and segment the parts that are speech and those that are noise. We then compute the volume of the speech and the noise to estimate the SNR.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Putting it all together", "text": "The front-end records the audio and sends it to the back-end in real-time. The back-end keeps a buffer of 5 seconds of audio that is sent to it by the front-end. The back-end then analyzes the buffer whenever queried by the front-end and returns the speech transmission index, as measured using the deep learning model described in Section 3, and the signal to noise ratio, as measured by the method described in Section 3. If there is no vocal activity detected in the last second of the buffer (the most recent second recorded by the user), the backend does not compute either quality measure, and instead reports that there is no vocal activity. The front-end then ceases visual feedback by greying out the boxes. The output of the back-end system is smoothed with median filtering to reduce the impact of outliers on user behavior. The user must maintain high sound quality over a considerable period of time.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "USER STUDY DESIGN", "text": "The purpose of our study was to see if the visual feedback about room acoustics and background noise provided by VoiceAssist encouraged the user to make the kind of adjustments that result in higher audio quality.

They recorded the passage using the traditional recording interface.

All recordings were done on a Blue Yeti microphone (a popular choice for voice recording) with a cardioid pickup pattern. The participants monitored their recording over headphones. In both locations, if a participant sat down and recorded without making any adjustments to the environment or the microphone placement, they would produce a recording of low quality. Only by making adjustments to the environment could they achieve high recording quality. The adjustments suggested in Figure 1 for improving audio quality was communicated to the users in both conditions prior to the study.
