(applause) - [Woman] In your coding scheme, how would you deal with value change over time, when for instance, one value might be explicitly exchanged with another one that's contradicting it or when participants might redefine how they understand a particular value? - So basically, the lengths that you create through the ethicograph which actually tells you about the change over time, the temporal aspect of things, would help us identify these kinds of changes but then, brand new identification would be very qualitative in terms of how would decode the speech act. - [Woman] With your graph you would see that the lines would stop, but there's another one that's basically the complementary of the opposite and that the two are related, that there's been a switch. - So, from the graph you would just try to identify whether it's a value centered or manipulative move, but to understand the variations in the values that are being accessed in the whole decision making, it should be probably qualitatively reconstructed to the speech act, rather than the graph giving direct information about it. - [Bill Heffley] Wonderful paper. Bill Heffley from UT Dallas. Question about your experimental design. Could you describe how you assigned the students, did they do one scenario first and then the other, or were they all independent. - No, so we had two different protocol studies, so the first protocol study was about the charity donation, we had three students for each session, and then there were four sessions in each protocol study, so they were separate, they were 12 students who participated in the first protocol, and 12 in the second. So they were completely different, and they were randomly assigned in a group from our undergradute and graduate student list. - [Man From Norway] (mumbles) from Norway. Could you reflect a little bit about the validity problems with your experiments, because you stated explicitly that they should be manipulative, which is not the case in the real world. Because nobody tells you, but it still happens. And then you used students who are not part of any sort of community of practice, and it's the, in this case the designers making the decisions, and in the real world, the decisions are often not made by designers, etc. etc. etc. So have you sort of reflected on how this validity problem, sort of how you should interpret your results in light of this validity question? - So that was the first question we always had in mind before designing, this whole setup. But we were trying to see how much of a, we were giving them authentic tasks that they would have to deal with in any kind of agency that they might work with. And in terms of how they were not explicitly told about these kinds of design decisions that they have to take. If you've observed these in the other sessions, like even in the ethical mediation people, where the stakeholder was explicitly telling them to constrain the user, so I think these different kinds of aspects would actually provide validity to how we have presented the design task, but then that is also a question that we have continuously kept in mind while doing the research design.

gaps, continuous interest is shown in discoveringmethods of building value-discovery and subsequent action into the design process in both CHI and design contexts (e.g., ).", " Other frameworks for ethical design exist beyond VSD, including approaches such as Values at Play , Value Levers , and In-Action Ethics .", " Values at Play focuses on the practice of game development, and is intended to

layer in Figure 1), building on common design activities described in previous design cognition studies, identifying the relationship of the design decision to a problem, solution or decision rationale.", " These codes are marked as the layers over the links created among the speech acts of the participants, and were iteratively determined by performing meaning reconstruction on key segments to identify how implicit values might inform explicit design decisions.", " These links aided us in evaluating the relationships between the idea codes and value codes to identify connections

formed."], [" In this section, we will describe the results from our analysis of each protocol separately.", " Each subsection of protocol results is organized by the values that participants implicitly or explicitly used to structure their work, and we rely upon the chain of decision-making documented in our ethicograph analysis to describe the interplay of multiple values and how they are inscribed in the design solutions.", " Each design task foregrounded different potential values, and so not all of the values proposed by Friedman  emerged equally (or at all) in each protocol task.", " A synthesis of findings across both protocol tasks is provided in the discussion section.", " While solving the given task to increase the conversion rate by \u201cany means necessary,\u201d

and aesthetics.", " The critical reconstructive analysis made possible through the ethicography method allowed us to identify these values,", " and assess their impact on the design situation.", " The following subsections will explain how different protocol teams concretized and operationalized these values in relation to specific design solutions.", " Right to Information.", " Participants in multiple teams identified that there was lack of information on the existing page, and re-design was required to present the information on the website that could attract donors and maximize the conversion rate.", " As a result, this user value was considered the most essential by participants in maximizing the conversion rate.", " This value was translated by the participants into various aspects of the final solutions, including: information graphics, statistics, descriptive text, user stories, and images.", " Participants in groups 1,2 & 4 reflected this value in \u2018progress bars\u2019 to show a real-time increase with the amount a donor donates, reaffirming their act of charity in a social manner.", " Participants in group 4 wanted to specifically include information on the site that described how the amount donated was used by the foundation to implement changes in \u201creal-life.\u201d This example shows how one value (right to information) was used to impact or provide an opportunity for another user value (trust) while making design decisions.", " Another common form of information that participants manipulated was visual imagery.", " Participants frequently discussed how images could \u201ctoy\u201d or play with user\u2019s emotions , thereby encouraging users to donate to the charity.", " Participants in Groups 1 and 2 also used images to humanize the", " charity, presenting stories of destruction and emphasizing the need to increase donations to fulfill the organization\u2019s mission.", " In parallel, participants in Group 2 also generated a solution that presented stories from the victims to engage the donors and emotionally convince them to donate to the charity.", " Participants in Group 4 similarly used \u201creal user stories\u201d as testimonials on the website to indirectly present the genuineness need of the organization, thus laying the groundwork for donations.", " \u201cUser stories\u201d were used in different ways to shape the user\u2019s experience, either placed before the donation took place to encourage users to donate, or as a substantiation once the donation had already occurred.", " These examples demonstrate the desire of the majority of participants to treat information as an \u201cincentive\u201d that could help to build the trust of the donor, thus resulting in an increased conversion rate.", " Other solutions that were vaguely discussed included the use of additional descriptive text on the website that present more details about the organization and the need for donations, including a more upfront presentation of news and events.", " Design activities shaped by this value generally resulted in positive, user-centered outcomes, although several of these design solutions also expressed a darker form of persuasion or gentle manipulation for users to donate to the charity.", " For example, a participant in Group 1 mentioned how the progress bar can alert the user to the state of emergency, thereby guilting users to donate more money.", " This group set the stage for this \u201cguilting\u201d behavior on the landing page to persuade users to donate more money by providing information about the average amount donated.", " They traded-off the ethics of presenting correct information with inflating the average donation, faking the amount to attract a higher average donation.", " Participants in Group 2 created a similar progress bar solution, but their stated intention was only to provide real-world information about the impact of the charity on the Houston area.", " However, this group decided to position the progress bar at the bottom of the website, with one participant mentioning \u201dbecause I think that could like if they\u2019ve already met their goal, people would be like, oh, I\u2019m not going to donate now.\u201d This design decision could thereby trick users in donating even if the organization had already reached their goal.", " Usability.", " The value of usability refers to creating a system that encourages users to successfully complete specific tasks.", " This value is recognized as a foundational principle of usercentered interaction in HCI.", " In our context, this value was reflected in the design decisions surrounding issues of visibility, accessibility, ease of use (automation), user control, aesthetics and efficiency.", " The major problem identified by all the groups was the poor visibility of the \u201cdonate\u201d link on the existing landing page.", " All participants proposed a", " similar solution to address this issue, designing a more visible button to highlight the \u201ccall for action,\u201d as this was the most essential function to reach the donation goal.", " Group 2 participants positioned the button on the top navigation bar for easy accessibility at all times, while Groups 1 and 2 were wary of mentioning the \u201cdonate\u201d button too many times on the website, as this could be construed as too needy, potentially interrupting other parts of the user experience.", " Group 1 discarded an initial idea of using persuasive terminology (e.g., \u201cmake an impact\u201d) for the button, but decided to keep it direct for the donor with a single button that said \u201cdonate.\u201d Additionally, participants were concerned about how to properly balance the values of right to information along with usability, creating links to easily access all the information regarding donations, news, and events.", " On the donation form, all the participants identified the length and complexity of the form, which created a perception that it would take a lot of time to fill in the requested details.", " Group 1 considered re-designing the donation form specifically to maximize donations, unlike the other groups who considered re-designing the donation form only to make it more usable and aesthetically pleasing.", " One value prominently seen in the solutions related to this problem was automation: filling in data from other sources to increase ease of use.", " This was mentioned to be a standard principle of good form design, and is essential to creating usable form experiences.", " One of the designers said: \u201c Another thing that, as UX people, we may or may not discuss,  code behind the form actually  auto save  all of your information.", " Once you start typing your name, it can actually auto fill all of this information, but it only does that if you use standard code.\u201d Considering this value, participants mentioned that it would save the user\u2019s time.", " When a participant in Group 1 mentioned this value, they knew that the form experience could only be made so efficient, but that the user could be made to feel it is shorter: \u201c the shorter it seems to the people, like okay, I could get through this process faster.", " The more likely they are to actually complete the task.", " If they, you know, they perceive that the task is going to take longer, which it\u2019s not, it\u2019s still going to take the same amount of time, but they think that scrolling down further.\u201d", " Other design decisions relating to usability included the provision of breadcrumb navigation for the website to encourage greater user control, redesign of the information architecture, using a one-page approach with greater visual consistency, and making the \u201chelp\u201d button more accessible by moving it from the footer.", " Groups 1 and 4 briefly discussed the heuristics of the navigation bar and form-like graphical elements on the landing page, but discontinued the discussion to prioritize the generation of more expansive solutions.", " Additionally, aesthetics is mostly considered while creating the designs.", " The designers of group 3 used this as their main", " value to re-design the existing features of the website.", " Their main intention was to build trust on the website with aesthetically pleasing website.", " All the designers did mention on getting minimalist design features from their inspirations of current websites and worked towards having a consistent visual language.", " Flexibility.", " The value of flexibility indicates the ability of users to go about a task in multiple ways.", " Participants in Group 1 group identified no freedom of choice for the donors in selecting donation amounts and payment methods.", " So the designers incorporated flexible entry of donation amounts by giving an empty box with hint text.", " On the other hand, participants in Group 3 had a similar solution, providing a fixed minimum amount that was set by the designers, but still allowing the donor to have control over the amount above the minimum.", " A Group 1 participant also mentioned the use of a concept of \u201ccranking\u201d to encouraged increased amounts of donation, but this idea was not considered by the group, as participants felt that it would overly control the user\u2019s decisions.", " Other participants in Group 1 provided users with a flexible choice of payment methods, such as PayPal and Venmo, encouraging donors to donate by increasing payment options.", " This increased set of options was also seen as a potential solution to reduce the form size and remove form fields.", " For example, if a user chose PayPal, they would not need to provide billing information that PayPal would already have on file.", " This design decision clearly underscores how one value supported another to improve the user experience and support specific design decisions.", " Security.", " While providing the multiple modes of payments, another main user value considered by participants was security.", " One participant described this concern, noting: \u201c some people don\u2019t want their credit cards to be on file, so there\u2019s, you know, privacy concern also, because the thing is uh, organizations like PayPal, Venmo, whatever, they actually provide you with certain kind of uh fraud protections, so if all of this does end up being a whole fake thing.\u201d The user value of considering users\u2019 privacy and the security of the system occurred only with Group 1, perhaps unsurprising, given the focus on outcomes (increasing donation conversion) rather than the resilience of the system.", " We do note an interplay of values in Group 1, however, that links usability, flexibility, and security.", " The remaining groups chose to focus on the usability and aesthetic qualities of the donation form over security or privacy, mentioning that the \u201cform should be as per present templates\u201d that users experience from all the e-commerce websites.", " This redirection may also reveal a hidden assumption that using design patterns from other contexts ensures privacy or security, obviating the team of the need attending to these values directly.", " Optimization.", " The value of optimization deals with the presentation of information from a technical perspective.", " Only Group 1 addressed design decisions that were shaped by this value, focusing on issues relating to video streaming on the website such as data-cap restrictions or technical implementation for users.", " To resolve this tension, the group replaced the video with an image collage.", " Most of the groups used this solution of presenting visual references and images, but in the case of these other groups, it related more to the value of right to information than optimization.", " This example demonstrates how different values can be used by a design team, that ultimately translate into the same design outcome; the individual designer and her judgment are thus responsible for generatively linking values to potential solutions.", " LP2: \u201cThis is What We Get Paid To Do\u201d In LP2, designers were asked to \u201cmanipulate users\u201d to increase the sales of the store brand on a drugstore website.", " While addressing this design task, participants identified a wide range of different solutions for the landing page, product detail page, and checkout page.", " The most commonly discussed human values that were inscribed into these solutions included: right to information, human welfare, usability, and ownership.", " As compared to the first protocol task, the application of user-focused values was much less frequent, as the task given was to trick users in a direct, rather than veiled manner.", " We anticipated, based on the results of LP1, that the participants would be less likely to engage user-focused values in their decision making to generate solutions, instead relying on dark patterns or persuasive techniques that reduced the agency of the user.", " The following subsections will explore how the different teams operationalized, and in many cases, subverted values in their design solutions.", " Right to Information.", " The majority of participants identified that store brand product informationwas notwell-represented on the landing page and product detail page.", " They targeted this problem by exposing more information about the store brand to customers by providing solutions such as comparison of product prices, equal coverage of all brands on the web page, mentioning the amount saved by buying the store brand product,quick descriptions of store brand products and presenting offers and advertisements.", " Groups 1 and 2 represented the right to information value by giving visibility to all the brands on one page through visual artifacts or brand promotions.", " Group 1 participants anticipated that this visibility would increase the familiarity and popularity of the brands to the customers, decreasing reliance on the brand details.", " Group 2 participants used prominence from the list of persuasive principles to highlight the store brand specifically upfront in all the sections of the website.", " They tried to incorporate information about the store brand, with", " one participant questioning: \u201c\u201c. . .maybe there should be  in more than just this  category.\u201d This idea of providing information was limited to the store brand and tweaked to \u201c.", " . . remove promotion of other  products.\u201d Participants in this group tried to separate the information about the store brand on the landing page of the website by making it difficult to access information of other brands.", " This example demonstrates how the same value was leveraged as a form of trade off to reach the goal of increasing sales.", " The group made a decision to not present \u201cactual competitors to , in any product line,\u201d explicitly noting that \u201c should not be included in the feature deals\u201d.", " Group 3 incorporated a similar feature, presenting the deals in the form of coupons that could only be used for the store brand, with text that claimed: \u201c health products will help you save money every day.\u201d", " While these solutions were intended to indirectly divert the customers towards store brand products, Group 3 participants also used this value to alter the way information was presented, encouraging users to read it more quickly with a clearer description.", " They suggested that this information should provide clear, short and bullet point descriptions, demonstrating why a certain product was better than a competing product.", " This design decision is connected to the human value of ownership, which puts the decision making in the hands of the customer.", " Group 4 designers provided information in the form of recommendations about what other customers buy highlighting the store brand along with other brands to indirectly nudge the users towards store brand.", " Group 1 participants used information to create comparisons among the brands to emphasize on the amount of money saved by purchasing the store brand compared to other brands.", " This was used as a trigger for the customers to make their decisions with this information on which product to buy.", " Alongside this comparison, they attached offers and advertisements to the store brand, increasing visibility as shown in the above examples.", " Similarly, Group 3 participants generated this solution with a different style of presenting the information in the last step of the task flow.", " They created a wire-frame to use a pop-up at the checkout page to provide an option saying \u201dIt looks like you bought this  did you know that you can save 20 dollars by switching these to  products?\u201d.", " This example relies upon the values of right to information and human welfare (discussed in the next section), demonstrating how the value of usability was traded off to present the information upfront while also purposefully obstructing the flow of the user.", " HumanWelfare.", " This value addresses concerns that deal with the physical, material, or psychological welfare of the users", " on the website.", " For the given task, material and psychological welfare was considered as a major factor as participants worked to support their economic interests and the emotional states of users.", " This value was primarily used in course-correcting their design decisions, ensuring that they were not \u201cannoying\u201d the user with too much information, or making the interface \u201csketchy\u201d or making it too hard to buy products.", " For example, participants in Group 1 were concerned about how much it was appropriate to advertise a brand, and how to know when they had gone too far.", " They were aware that the user should not be annoyed with the site: \u201cAs a person,you just go there , I think that would be like, \u201cOh,  is pushing their brand on me and stuff.\u201d This value was observed in support of \u201cright to information\u201d in numerous cases, but was primarily violated through the emotional experience that the revised materials evoked.", " For example, Group 2 participants discussed how to present promotions of the store brand by using an user story of an healthy elderly person to have a \u201cstriking advertisement\u201d to build a \u201cstrong connection.\u201d Group 2 participants also tried to use the \u201cexclusivity\u201d persuasive principle on the checkout page by implementing a visual of a clock ticking, assuring themselves: \u201cIt will give  some pressure.\u201d Group 3 had a similar solution to present sales for limited time to urge the users to buy specific products, but with some remorse; one participant mentioned \u201cI feel so dirty,\u201d but \u201cWe get paid the big bucks for this.\u201d", " The participants in Groups 1 and 2 supported the value of \u201cRight to Information\u201d in conjunction with user welfare by targeting users\u2019 economic status.", " Solutions based on this value included explicitly visualizing savings and providing \u201ccheap\u201d store brand options on the check-out page and in feature deals.", " Group 1 participants also identified a solution that provided an artificial projection of sales of certain products, but later discarded this concept, worried that it could annoy users and that they \u201c want to manipulate.\u201d Group 2 and 3 participants generated solutions to make it more difficult to buy the products of the competitor brands of store brand, but they reconsidered this solution when they realized that users might be annoyed, and they \u201c really want to hurt them\u201d.", " Usability.", " Participants engagedwith this value as they sought to provide consistency across multiple pages, design interactions that felt \u201cnatural,\u201d create filters to navigate through a range of choices, and identify ways to provide less-cluttered interfaces.", " Group 1 participants provided filters for easy sorting of items on the website based on the brand, while Groups 3 and 4 generated a solution that gave priority to store brand items, pinning them to the top of the list to increase the visibility of the brand name in the filters option list.", " Participants in Group 2 also increased the visibility of the store", " brand on the landing page, with the goal that: \u201csubconsciously your eyes are just drawn right away.", " Like, hierarchy definitely shows .", " . . people always want to select the biggest thing on the page .", " . . something\u2019s really small, kind of looks like it\u2019s lower quality or, like, just not the best product for the user.\u201d Similarly, Group 4 participants generated ideas that positioned the store brand at \u201cthe center of website, and other products at corner of the website,\u201d violating the principle of consistency with persuasive intent.", " Multiple strategies were used to balance usability and the need to create a persuasive experience, which often identified tensions between these values.", " A member of Group 1 mentioned that they should be \u201ctrying to make the process of checkout more \u2018natural\u2019,\u201d while Group 2 participants used reduction and tunneling effects to make it difficult to buy off brand products.", " Participants in Group 2 achieved their goal by making it easy to buy store brand products through oneclick checkout, while introducing a longer task flow with a login process if the user wished to buy brand name products.", " This group anticipated making users wanting to create an account to buy one product on the website would lead them to buy the store brand which was much easier to achieve.", " This is another example that demonstrates how a value can be leveraged to support the goals of multiple stakeholders, even as it also introduces conflicts

We defined a value code as a the likely intent of the speech act that would represent the participant's tacit or explicit attitude towards one or more values. This varied in a spectrum of design acts from being ethically sound to being manipulative. We also categorized an idea code for each speech act, building on common design activities described in previous design cognition studies. This code identifies the relation of the speech act to a problem, solution, intended behavior, or the decision rationale.

(applause) - [Woman] In your coding scheme, how would you deal with value change over time, when for instance, one value might be explicitly exchanged with another one that's contradicting it or when participants might redefine how they understand a particular value? - So basically, the lengths that you create through the ethicograph which actually tells you about the change over time, the temporal aspect of things, would help us identify these kinds of changes but then, brand new identification would be very qualitative in terms of how would decode the speech act. - [Woman] With your graph you would see that the lines would stop, but there's another one that's basically the complementary of the opposite and that the two are related, that there's been a switch. - So, from the graph you would just try to identify whether it's a value centered or manipulative move, but to understand the variations in the values that are being accessed in the whole decision making, it should be probably qualitatively reconstructed to the speech act, rather than the graph giving direct information about it. - [Bill Heffley] Wonderful paper. Bill Heffley from UT Dallas. Question about your experimental design. Could you describe how you assigned the students, did they do one scenario first and then the other, or were they all independent. - No, so we had two different protocol studies, so the first protocol study was about the charity donation, we had three students for each session, and then there were four sessions in each protocol study, so they were separate, they were 12 students who participated in the first protocol, and 12 in the second. So they were completely different, and they were randomly assigned in a group from our undergradute and graduate student list. - [Man From Norway] (mumbles) from Norway. Could you reflect a little bit about the validity problems with your experiments, because you stated explicitly that they should be manipulative, which is not the case in the real world. Because nobody tells you, but it still happens. And then you used students who are not part of any sort of community of practice, and it's the, in this case the designers making the decisions, and in the real world, the decisions are often not made by designers, etc. etc. etc. So have you sort of reflected on how this validity problem, sort of how you should interpret your results in light of this validity question? - So that was the first question we always had in mind before designing, this whole setup. But we were trying to see how much of a, we were giving them authentic tasks that they would have to deal with in any kind of agency that they might work with. And in terms of how they were not explicitly told about these kinds of design decisions that they have to take. If you've observed these in the other sessions, like even in the ethical mediation people, where the stakeholder was explicitly telling them to constrain the user, so I think these different kinds of aspects would actually provide validity to how we have presented the design task, but then that is also a question that we have continuously kept in mind while doing the research design.
