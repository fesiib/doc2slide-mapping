(applause) - [Woman] In your coding scheme, how would you deal with value change over time, when for instance, one value might be explicitly exchanged with another one that's contradicting it or when participants might redefine how they understand a particular value? - So basically, the lengths that you create through the ethicograph which actually tells you about the change over time, the temporal aspect of things, would help us identify these kinds of changes but then, brand new identification would be very qualitative in terms of how would decode the speech act. - [Woman] With your graph you would see that the lines would stop, but there's another one that's basically the complementary of the opposite and that the two are related, that there's been a switch. - So, from the graph you would just try to identify whether it's a value centered or manipulative move, but to understand the variations in the values that are being accessed in the whole decision making, it should be probably qualitatively reconstructed to the speech act, rather than the graph giving direct information about it. - [Bill Heffley] Wonderful paper. Bill Heffley from UT Dallas. Question about your experimental design. Could you describe how you assigned the students, did they do one scenario first and then the other, or were they all independent. - No, so we had two different protocol studies, so the first protocol study was about the charity donation, we had three students for each session, and then there were four sessions in each protocol study, so they were separate, they were 12 students who participated in the first protocol, and 12 in the second. So they were completely different, and they were randomly assigned in a group from our undergradute and graduate student list. - [Man From Norway] (mumbles) from Norway. Could you reflect a little bit about the validity problems with your experiments, because you stated explicitly that they should be manipulative, which is not the case in the real world. Because nobody tells you, but it still happens. And then you used students who are not part of any sort of community of practice, and it's the, in this case the designers making the decisions, and in the real world, the decisions are often not made by designers, etc. etc. etc. So have you sort of reflected on how this validity problem, sort of how you should interpret your results in light of this validity question? - So that was the first question we always had in mind before designing, this whole setup. But we were trying to see how much of a, we were giving them authentic tasks that they would have to deal with in any kind of agency that they might work with. And in terms of how they were not explicitly told about these kinds of design decisions that they have to take. If you've observed these in the other sessions, like even in the ethical mediation people, where the stakeholder was explicitly telling them to constrain the user, so I think these different kinds of aspects would actually provide validity to how we have presented the design task, but then that is also a question that we have continuously kept in mind while doing the research design.
