    "text": "ABSTRACT Many touch based interactions provide limited opportunities for direct tactile feedback; examples include multi-user touch displays, augmented reality based projections on passive surfaces, and mid-air input. In this paper, we consider distal feedback, through vibrotactile stimulation on a smart-watch placed on the user’s non-dominant wrist, as an alternative feedback mechanism to interaction location vibrotactile feedback, under the user’s finger. We compare the effectiveness of interaction location feedback vs. distal feedback through a Fitts’s Law task completed on a smartphone. Results show that distal and interaction location feedback both reduce errors in target acquisition and exhibit statistically comparable performance, suggesting that distal vibrotactile feedback is a suitable alternative when interaction location feedback is not readily available."

The most common form of interaction with personal, public, and virtual display screens is some form of gesture - using either 2D touch or 3D motion to manipulate content. While there are several challenges with gestural interaction, the specific challenge we seek to address is feedback. When one touches a flat display (or gestures at a virtual screen) there is no physical sensation of widget interaction [5]. This lack of feedback is a known challenge on touchscreen displays, which a large body of research attempts to overcome by using haptic effects [6, 18, 19, 22, 26, 36]. Similarly, commercial smartphones and tablets use vibration to communicate to the user that contact has been made with a target. Whether one uses vibration or some other form of haptic stimulation, the design of these feedback techniques makes two assumptions: first, the device has some sort of physical"

Typical haptic effects such as electrostatic vibration [36], the squeeze film effect [7], or the use of the internal vibration motor on a mobile device all manipulate the entire display or the entire device. To localize effects, we determine the user’s contact point and movement, what effect we wish to convey at that point, and time the generated haptic effect to coincide exactly with the user’s position. While this is not a problem for single-user physical displays, it does not allow multiple users to interact simultaneously nor does it support feedback for virtual screens. While one can imagine engineering solutions to segment haptic displays [3] or to artificially stimulate fingers in midair [6, 26], we wondered whether some other form of feedback, e.g. vibration, could be provided distally (on a location other than the interaction site), and whether that vibration feedback could then support target acquisition tasks. Given that smartphones use vibration to communicate target acquisition, could we leverage a convenience device like a smartwatch to provide feedback at another on-body location during interactions when interaction location feedback is impractical (e.g. when a display is shared or virtual)? In this paper we explore the effectiveness of smartwatchbased feedback as an aid to target acquisition with the dominant hand. We do this by quantitatively assessing the performance of smartwatch-based vibration feedback during touchscreen interaction to under-finger vibration. This experiment demonstrates parity in performance between localized feedback – where the touchscreen device provides vibration – and distal feedback – where vibration is provided by the smartwatch. In essence, our results argue that, if vibrotactile feedback is desired but cannot be provided under the finger, that providing vibrotactile feedback via another mobile, personal device can effectively support interaction."

More recent work by Zhang and Harrison [36] explored how best to render one category of tactile effect – electrovibration, where an alternating voltage varies the feeling of “rubberiness” of the surface – to maximally improve targeting performance. While many of these tactile effects have been explored in research systems, the most common form of tactile feedback employed on commercial smartphones is vibration [28].

      "text": "more recent work has focused on the design of vibrotactile stimuli [17, 28]. Current vibrotactile effects are provided by a small electrical motor with a slightly off-balance shaft. When vibration is desired, the motor spins the shaft, and the outof-balance mass causes a small vibration in the device. This type of vibration device is called an electrically rotating mass (ERM) component. Vibrotactile feedback on touch-screens has proven an effective method to reduce errors in targeting tasks, such as text input on PDAs or smartphones [4, 14]. We know that targeting aids are important, particularly for acquisition of small targets: Hoggan et al. [14] noted frustration among users for touch-screen targeting as the user’s finger may block the target from their field of view. When this happens, the user would have no visual indication if they are correctly hitting the target. This issue of occlusion is often attributed to the size of the user’s finger, i.e. the fat finger problem [31]. However, situations exist where under-finger or interaction location feedback is impractical for targeting tasks, such as virtual reality, augmented reality or multi-user scenarios. Solutions to these domains include haptic feedback on a wand [18] or stylus [10, 19] on contact with a target, and vibration on a mobile phone when augmented reality targets come into view [1]. The drawback of techniques like these is they encumber the hand being used for interaction. To avoid this problem, we we consider distal feedback as an alternative to interaction location feedback. There is some reason to believe that wrist-worn feedback on the arm associated with interaction [15] might provide benefits because, as the user makes contact with something, the wrist-based vibration will vibrate bones in the wrist and hand and transmit the vibrotactile effect to the point of interaction. Leveraging this idea of skeletal transmission, Maeda et al. [22] describe the design of wrist-worn vibration to enhance haptic effects during interaction, including enhancing interaction in virtual environments [23]. It is less clear whether vibrotactile effects that are more distantly separated from interaction are beneficial. In virtual or augmented reality, Kaul et al. [16] looked at adding haptic effects to a VR or AR headset to improve targeting and found that it was not particularly effective, while Richter et al. [30] examined various configurations of body-worn haptic feedback during typing tasks and found improved performance. We are not the first to explore wrist-won tactile feedback: the evaluation of wrist-worn tactile feedback has been explored for typing on a touch tabletop with wrist-worn tactile output provided on the users input arm by McAdam and Brewster [24, 25]. In this prior work, an actuator is attached using a tubegrip bandage to the same side of the body that is used for interaction. We extend this research with two key differences. First, we use an off-the-shelf smartwatch, a commodity device, rather than an actuator held in tight contact"

Second, we administer feedback on the wrist of the non-dominant (typically noninteractive) hand (versus the dominant/interactive hand as in McAdam and Brewster) because the majority of people wear their watch on their non-dominant wrist [32]. Alongside the work of McAdam and Brewster, Tankana et al. [34] have explored distal feedback on a users non-dominant hand in the application of forceps manipulation for laparoscopic surgery, but their study is limited to finger-only feedback and they do not compare this to other feedback types - including forceps (proximal) feedback, or locations beyond fingers/a specialized haptic display. In summary, despite past work, it is unknown how vibrotactile feedback from a smartwatch worn on the wrist of the non-dominant hand would compare to interaction location vibrotactile feedback provided under a user’s finger via vibration of a touch surface. Researchers have also explored the design of tactile feedback, but have found few benefits in targeting tasks [11, 24]. McAdam and Brewster hypothesize that benefits of distal vibrotactile feedback may be reduced due to target size, since Fitts’s Law shows that as target size increases, they become easier to acquire, i.e. if targets are large enough, tactile feedback may not be required [24]. Thus, we see benefit in studying a standard Fitts’s law task, usingmore challenging targets to acquire, to further explore the distal feedback phenomenon."

Should a device vibrate when the user enters the target, then stop, or should the device continue to vibrate continuously while a user is within the target? Inspired by past work Zhang et al. [36] on vibrotactile feedback, we conducted an initial pilot study to evaluate four different feedback conditions: no feedback, fill feedback, center feedback (where 1/4 of the target provided feedback to guide participants to the center of the target and reduce errors), and line leading edge feedback (see Figure 2)."

We also collected timing information. RM-ANOVAS indicated that there was no significant effect of condition on elapsed time (F1.061,15.917 = 1.032,p = ns,η2 = 0.00179), or condition on error rate (F1.061,15.917 = 1.12,p = ns,η2 = 0.00195). This analysis suggests that the techniques were comparable and error rates differed only marginally between techniques. We also examined survey results to uncover user preferences. While we found that participants preferred vibrotactile feedback on the smartphone, the smartwatch was also highly rated in comments. In terms of the specific haptic feedback conditions, participants found the fill technique the easiest to use overall because it provided constant feedback when over the target (i.e. participants were not required to search for the actual target on the display). Alongside understanding how best to apply vibrotactile effects, one strongly positive result from our study is that participants highlighted no perceived difficulties in integrating distal watch feedback from the non-dominant arm with on-screen interaction. One participant noted that, as he interacted with small targets using the watch, he became convinced that we were also doing “something with the phone too” and, when re-assured that we were not, that the watch and phone were distinct, he noted that it was “amazing how fast [we] re-wired [his] brain” (to associate the distal feedback to an interaction location location). The promising results from this pilot study motivated a more complete study of smartwatch-based vibrotactile feedback."

We discarded the data from our initial experiment and reran our experiment with four factors. With this change, our final experimental design included four vibrotactile feedback conditions: feedback on the smartphone (interaction location) with no delay, feedback on the smartphone with a 39ms delay (interaction location delay), feedback on a smartwatch worn on the user’s non-dominant wrist (distal) and a control condition (no feedback)."

Our results provide evidence that phone feedback and watch feedback have similar performance characteristics, in terms of time and error rate. This, in turn, argues that smartwatch feedback is an effective alternative to interaction location feedback. In particular, we find no significant difference between watch and phone with and without delay in time and error rate. In fact, qualitatively we note that, while watch feedback is slower on average than phone feedback, watch feedback also has the lowest error rate. The primary difference between under-finger feedback and smartwatch feedback appears to be Bluetooth delay, due to the similarity between under-finger feedback with delay and smartwatch feedback, but this delay does not result in significant differences in timing.

To more fully probe the increased time associated with feedback conditions, we examine an interaction effect that exists between feedback condition and target width. Figure 9 shows time per condition per width. Here, we can clearly see the Bluetooth delay slowing interaction, with both phone with delay and smartwatch conditions taking more time than the phone condition without delay and the no feedback condition."

There is some question as to whether it is even reasonable to include these targets in a targeting experiment. Our rationale was to include them simply because we do see these targeting tasks in interfaces, particularly when resolution is high and displays are small or packed with widgets. Alongside email editing, mentioned earlier, if one uses a standard web interface on a smartphone or one uses a mobile remote desktop application, widgets are sized for pixels significantly different in scale to the tightly packed pixels on a typical phone screen. In these exceptional targeting tasks, the Fitts’s curves on Figure 7 are instructive. Recall that these curves omit these targets when drawing the best-fit line. We do this because of Figure 9, where we see performance vary with these targets, and also because of Figure 8, where we see very high error rates. In the No Feedback condition, Figure 7d, the 1.3mm and 1.9mm target times are all under the Fitts’s Law curve, whereas in every other condition they are all, without exception, over the curve. We see a similar effect in Figure 9: 3.2mm, 1.9mm, and 1.3mm targets have very similar times in the no feedback condition. Let us perform a simple mental experiment: assume that, all other things being equal, any average time versus ID point is normally distributed around the Fitts’s Law curve with its mean centred on the curve. This is standard Fitts’s Law behaviour [8]: For any given point in a best-fit line, there is a 50-50 chance that a randomly chosen point will be above the line or below the line, with its expected location centred on the line. What is the likelihood, as observed in Figure 7, that all points for 1.3mm and 1.9mm target points are below the line in Figure 7d (control condition) and all 1.3mm and 1.9mm target points are above the line in each experimental condition?

If, in vibrotactile conditions, the user, instead, assumed that they could complete the difficult task, then they might feel around, subtly try to position their finger, then recognize that the task was extremely hard and that their error rate was high, but that interaction was still possible. Thus, again, Fitts’s law might partially break down, but in the opposite way: because of errors, the participants would be biased toward being more careful and points would exist above the line [35]."

If we examine Figure 8, one thing that is clear is that the effect of feedback on error rate is marginal for targets larger than 6.3mm in size. This is undoubtedly because visual feedback is sufficient to ensure contact with target, a result previously hypothesized by McAdam and Brewster [24]. However, does this mean that vibrotactile feedback, where the phone vibrates when buttons are pressed, is to be avoided? We would argue that it does not. While there is no temporal or error rate advantage to vibrotactile feedback for these conditions, there is also no penalty. Furthermore, it does provide the user with confidence, during interaction, that the button was acquired and pressed, potentially allowing them to go on to the next task without awaiting on-screen confirmation. Due to the density of on-screen widgets in feature-rich smartphone applications, and to its ability to provide non-visual confirmation, we feel there exists a value to feedback that extends beyond raw time and error-rate values. This paper focused primarily on one type of distal vibrotactile feedback, provided by a smartwatch worn on the nondominant hand during dominant-hand interaction. Clearly a myriad of other distal vibration devices can be conceptualized: users could hold their phone in their non-preferred handwhile interacting; users couldwear their smartwatch on their dominant hand such that the vibration would be closer to the locus of interaction; we could design custom jewelry such as a wristband, ring, earring, necklace, or even use a piece of clothing; the device could be in the user’s pocket instead of in their hand; we could build complex external hardware that would make the air vibrate at an arbitrary"

Alongside additional contact locations, another avenue of future work could explore distal vibrotactile feedback in multi-user scenarios. Multi-user scenarios are a strong motivational factor for distal feedback because, when multiple users interact with a single screen, it becomes challenging to vibrate only a portion of the screen under a single user’s finger. Furthermore, when multiple users – beyond two, for example – all interact simultaneously, the need, to selectively provide tailored feedback for a subset of users further exacerbates hardware design challenges.

      "text": "Current vibrotactile hardware, while effective in providing simple feedback, cannot typically handle multi-user scenarios nor projected display scenarios (particularly when the projected surface is an inanimate artifact such as a wall or an artificial surface as in augmented or virtual reality). In these situations, it makes sense to leverage other existing devices that can offer vibrotactile feedback. Smartwatches, in particular, seem well-positioned to support interaction; they are readily available, and, without repositioning or grasping, can immediately be used to interact with external computation such that vibrotactile feedback from the watch can be used as a proxy for under-finger feedback. Our experiment demonstrates that the effects of distal feedback provided by the smartwatch are virtually identical to interaction location feedback on the touchscreen – particularly once Bluetooth delay is incorporated into the feedback. These results – in particular, the fact that distal feedback reduces error rate compared to know feedback as effectively as under-finger feedback – demonstrate that distal vibrotactile feedback can be an effective proxy for interaction location feedback."
