Tankana also looked at using vibration on the non-dominant hand's fingers to understand what's going on while using a pair or forceps with your dominant hand, particularly in computer-enhanced surgical procedures.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 6, "startTime": 150.0, "endTime": 206.0, "script": "So a lot of these systems in the literature, like McAdam, Maeda and Tankana, they all use specialized vibration systems but what we're curious about is if you can support this dominant hand interaction with vibrotactile feedback from a commodity smart watch on the non-dominant hand or the non-dominant wrist and we wanted to look at this for two reasons. First, there's an advantage to doing it this way. It's convenient, these devices are broadly available and a lot of people understand what they're doing and their purpose. Second, a lot of vibrotactile feedback techniques have been explored on the wrist of the same hand that people are interacting with which is actually not where these devices are typically worn and we were also not aware of any previous literature that looks at this opposing location as a location for vibrotactile feedback.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 7, "startTime": 206.0, "endTime": 218.67, "script": "So that's the question we're asking in this paper, can we use a convenience device, like a smartwatch, to provide distal vibrotactile feedback as a proxy for interaction location feedback?", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 8, "startTime": 218.67, "endTime": 253.33, "script": "So in our study we used two devices. We uses a Huawei Nexus 6P smartphone where the user would interact and receive vibration feedback and then for distal feedback we used a Sony SmartWatch 3 where people would receive feedback upon acquiring target on the mobile phone. Each device used an ERM vibration motor which is basically just a standard vibration motor on the commodity devices and we used Bluetooth to facilitate communication between the smartphone and the smartwatch.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 9, "startTime": 253.33, "endTime": 295.33, "script": "So before we ran the main study, one of the big questions we wanted to ask is how do we actually provide this vibrotactile feedback? So do we provide vibration while the user's finger is within the entire target? Do we try and get the user to move closer to the center of the target and vibrate there in order to reduce errors by them lifting off? Do we tell the user that they've entered the target by just vibrating near the edges or do we not give them feedback at all? So we actually did a quick test using a Fitts's ISO Task to compare the distal feedback to interaction location feedback.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 10, "startTime": 295.33, "endTime": 331.33, "script": "And what we found is that essentially, participants seemed to prefer this fill style of feedback across both the watch and phone conditions. Participants also rated both the watch, or distal feedback, and phone, or interaction location feedback, quite highly which showed promise for exploring these further and one participant particularly noted that they felt it was amazing that we were able to rewire their brain to associate this distal feedback to an interaction location so that gave some merit for studying this further.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 11, "startTime": 331.33, "endTime": 389.33, "script": "So after the pilot we fleshed out an experimental design. So to reiterate, our goal is to assess how distal vibrotactile feedback or smartwatch feedback compares to interaction location vibrotactile feedback, or under the finger feedback. And from the pilot we determined that fill feedback was most appropriate. We also had some other design considerations and these were that we wanted to look at smaller targets and this is because of the literature. Vibration feedback is generally more beneficial for these smaller targets so we figured that was a good point to look at and also we wanted to look at the cost associated with Bluetooth delay for communicating feedback to the watch so in other words, what is the cost of moving the feedback to a distal location? Including the time costs of sending the message to start the vibration and do the benefits outweigh this cost?", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 12, "startTime": 389.33, "endTime": 434.67, "script": "So this led us to the following experimental design. So first of all we have a series of target sizes that are inspired by typical target sizes on a mobile device. So one and two centimeters are fairly large mobile targets and one centimeter is similar to the home button here at the bottom. 6.3 millimeters is actually drawn from Android guidelines which is typically the smallest recommended button size and then we have three smaller sizes. So 3.2 millimeters was about the size of a text key, 1.3 millimeters which is approximately the inner word spacing in a line of text and 1.9 millimeters which is approximately the height of a line of text before zooming. So this gave us six different target sizes that we were investigating.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 13, "startTime": 434.67, "endTime": 462.0, "script": "So the experimental task was a Fitts's ISO Task so basically participants were instructed to select the blue target as the starting point, they were to move their index finger from the blue target to the red target and then lift their finger once it was within the red target and this is when they received the vibrotactile feedback. Text feedback was also provided at the top left hand corner just to indicate whether or not the participant had completed the selection correctly.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 14, "startTime": 462.0, "endTime": 486.67, "script": "Alongside this we had four conditions, so we had interaction location or phone feedback as condition one, we had phone feedback plus delay which was a Bluetooth delay which we calculated as 39 milliseconds as condition two and we have distal or watch feedback as condition three and then no feedback as a control condition or condition four.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 15, "startTime": 486.67, "endTime": 532.0, "script": "So in our evaluation we had the following hypotheses, we hypothesize that vibrotactile feedback will improve targeting time compared to no feedback. As well, this is largely due to the user having an additional indicator of acquiring a target so we expect them to be faster. Second, we expect vibrotactile feedback to lower error rate compared to no feedback. Again, because the user has this additional indicator of acquiring the target. Lastly, we expect participants to prefer feedback conditions over no feedback for the reasons I said prior and we do expect people to prefer the phone feedback over watch feedback, largely because they're used to it.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 16, "startTime": 532.0, "endTime": 549.33, "script": "So this just kind of summarizes what we did, we had a within-subjects design, 16 participants and it was counter balanced using a Latin Square design and basically we just collected over 23,000 targeting tasks to evaluate the phenomenon.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 17, "startTime": 549.33, "endTime": 598.0, "script": "So moving on to results of our study, time was actually our most surprising result since we thought that feedback would improve time but we actually found the opposite. So the graph on the left here depicts average time to acquire a target on the y axis, via target width on the x axis. So what we found was that no feedback, gray on the graph, was actually faster than feedback and in particular much faster for small targets and that phone with delay and watch feedback were statistically significantly slower than no feedback. So no feedback is a shorter time but then as the targets get larger they all kind of converge on the same time so no benefit really either way and we were really interested in investigating what might be going on here so we looked at it a bit further.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 18, "startTime": 598.0, "endTime": 682.67, "script": "So we broke these results down into a Fitts's Law analysis. These graphs are scatter plots, the average time selected target by Fitts's IDs for each condition. We drew a line of best fit for targets greater than or equal to 3.2 millimeters which are just typical target sizes on mobile devices and I'm gonna highlight two main components of this slide. So first, looking at targets from two centimeters to 3.2 millimeters you kinda see all of these targets following a standard Fitts's Law behavior in terms of time. It doesn't really appear that feedback harms performance time in any of these typical targets. But then when you look at exceptionally small targets such as 1.3 millimeters or 1.9 millimeters you can see Fitts's Law sort of break down. And you can see in the no feedback conditions, average time for these small targets lie exclusively below the line of best fit but in the feedback conditions average times lie exclusively above the line of best fit. And this is interesting because while we can't really measure what's going on in people's minds while they're interacting, we think that they might have felt like they actually could succeed when there was feedback there but when there was no feedback they kind of just gave up which is why the time kind of just went up.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 19, "startTime": 682.67, "endTime": 726.67, "script": "We can see this as well a little bit in errors. The graph here depicts error rate by target width and you'll notice that error rate drops as targets (coughing) and we found that with feedback people are more accurate and particularly that in phone with delay and watch feedback people are statistically significantly more accurate than no feedback. 1.3 millimeters and 1.9 millimeter targets are still very difficult to hit on a smartphone as they're much smaller than a finger but you'll notice that people actually think they can hit them and so oftentimes they do which we see in this small little difference in error rate and so we attribute this to people actually trying to hit the target.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 20, "startTime": 726.67, "endTime": 764.67, "script": "The last thing that we looked at was user preference. The graph here depicts distribution of participants by preference ranking. So we see that people value feedback. No feedback being rated least preferred by 14 out of 16 of our participants. Also, one participant rated no feedback first, which you can see in the gray bar of the first bar and they said they chose no feedback first because they were more frustrated when they got it wrong when there was feedback there so essentially, if they were going to fail they would rather fail with no feedback.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 21, "startTime": 764.67, "endTime": 835.33, "script": "So what's next for this research? So to sort of wrap up a little bit, as these interactive displays become more ubiquitous such as virtual displays projected onto a surface or in air, we wonder if this vibration feedback, particularly when it's applied distally, will also assist in target acquisition? Especially since these surfaces may be less familiar for interaction. Multi user scenarios are also a clear use case after this phenomenon so we think it makes sense to explore that next. Additionally, clearly we can imagine other places where you could provide distal vibrotactile feedback such as your phone in your pocket, on smart glasses, on your headphones or other wearables but we figure that as smartwatches are one of the most popular wearables now that their assessment was a good starting point. So we're also wondering if we could perhaps redesign vibrotactile feedback using the second type of feedback, which in our pilot study to kind of guide the user to the center of the target. This way, when they lift off they're less likely to lift off outside of the target and more likely to actually acquire it.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 22, "startTime": 835.33, "endTime": 853.33, "script": "So to conclude, we present a Fitts's Law analysis of distal vibrotactile feedback via a smartwatch and thus we conclude that distal vibrotactile feedback via smartwatch can serve as an effective proxy for this interaction location feedback.", "ocrResult": ""}, {"index": 23, "startTime": 853.33, "endTime": 948.0, "script": "So I thank you all for attending my talk and I can now take any questions. (applause) - [Man] So okay any questions please. Walk towards the mic and speak (mumbles). No questions? Okay well I have at least one question. So well before I tell my question, please do not leave this session because I have one announcement to make so hang out a little bit. Okay Jay, my question to you is on this spectrum of vibrations to no feedback at all do you try to consider anything with, let's say, regional call outs or a little bit intermediary feedback? - Right yeah so we definitely did consider using call outs, however we kinda think that deploying a call out in this might introduce an additional compound because we just wanted to look at targeting and then if we have another factor incorporated into that it could introduce some negative. However, we are curious kinda to see how these two things could be used in conjunction with one another and how this vibrotactile feedback accompanied with a call out could help users in acquiring targets. - [Man] Thank you.

with the dominant hand.", " We do this by quantitatively assessing the performance of smartwatch-based vibration feedback during touchscreen interaction to under-finger vibration.", " This experiment demonstrates parity in performance between localized feedback \u2013 where the touchscreen device provides vibration \u2013 and distal feedback \u2013 where vibration is provided by the smartwatch.", " In essence, our results argue that, if vibrotactile feedback is desired but cannot be provided under the finger, that providing vibrotactile feedback via another mobile, personal device can effectively support interaction."], [" Motivated by work by Cockburn and Brewster in multimodal feedback effects on targeting [9], many researchers have explored the various ways that tactile feedback can be used to enhance targeting performance.", " Levesque et al.", " [20] and Casiez et al.", " [7] demonstrated the advantages of surface friction with respect to targeting performance.", " More recent work by Zhang and Harrison [36] explored how best to render one category of tactile effect \u2013 electrovibration, where an alternating voltage varies the feeling of \u201crubberiness\u201d of the surface \u2013 to maximally improve targeting performance.", " While many of these tactile effects have been explored in research systems, the most common form of tactile feedback employed on commercial smartphones is vibration [28].", " Early research in this space explored how best to design hardware to support vibrotactile feedback [27, 29], while", " more recent work has focused on the design of vibrotactile stimuli [17, 28].", " Current vibrotactile effects are provided by a small electrical motor with a slightly off-balance shaft.", " When vibration is desired, the motor spins the shaft, and the outof-balance mass causes a small vibration in the device.", " This type of vibration device is called an electrically rotating mass (ERM) component.", " Vibrotactile feedback on touch-screens has proven an effective method to reduce errors in targeting tasks, such as text input on PDAs or smartphones [4, 14].", " We know that targeting aids are important, particularly for acquisition of small targets: Hoggan et al.", " [14] noted frustration among users for touch-screen targeting as the user\u2019s finger may block the target from their field of view.", " When this happens, the user would have no visual indication if they are correctly hitting the target.", " This issue of occlusion is often attributed to the size of the user\u2019s finger, i.e.", " the fat finger problem [31].", " However, situations exist where under-finger or interaction location feedback is impractical for targeting tasks, such as virtual reality, augmented reality or multi-user scenarios.", " Solutions to these domains include haptic feedback on a wand [18] or stylus [10, 19] on contact with a target, and vibration on a mobile phone when augmented reality targets come into view [1].", " The drawback of techniques like these is they encumber the hand being used for interaction.", " To avoid this problem, we we consider distal feedback as an alternative to interaction location feedback.", " There is some reason to believe that wrist-worn feedback on the arm associated with interaction [15] might provide benefits because, as the user makes contact with something, the wrist-based vibration will vibrate bones in the wrist and hand and transmit the vibrotactile effect to the point of interaction.", " Leveraging this idea of skeletal transmission, Maeda et al.", " [22] describe the design of wrist-worn vibration to enhance haptic effects during interaction, including enhancing interaction in virtual environments [23].", " It is less clear whether vibrotactile effects that are more distantly separated from interaction are beneficial.", " In virtual or augmented reality, Kaul et al.", " [16] looked at adding haptic effects to a VR or AR headset to improve targeting and found that it was not particularly effective, while Richter et al.", " [30] examined various configurations of body-worn haptic feedback during typing tasks and found improved performance.", " We are not the first to explore wrist-won tactile feedback: the evaluation of wrist-worn tactile feedback has been explored for typing on a touch tabletop with wrist-worn tactile output provided on the users input arm by McAdam and Brewster [24, 25].", " In this prior work, an actuator is attached using a tubegrip bandage to the same side of the body that is used for interaction.", " We extend this research with two key differences.", " First, we use an off-the-shelf smartwatch, a commodity device, rather than an actuator held in tight contact", " with the skin via a tubegrip bandage.", " Second, we administer feedback on the wrist of the non-dominant (typically noninteractive) hand (versus the dominant/interactive hand as in McAdam and Brewster) because the majority of people wear their watch on their non-dominant wrist [32].", " Alongside the work of McAdam and Brewster, Tankana et al.", " [34] have explored distal feedback on a users non-dominant hand in the application of forceps manipulation for laparoscopic surgery, but their study is limited to finger-only feedback and they do not compare this to other feedback types - including forceps (proximal) feedback, or locations beyond fingers/a specialized haptic display.", " In summary, despite past work, it is unknown how vibrotactile feedback from a smartwatch worn on the wrist of the non-dominant hand would compare to interaction location vibrotactile feedback provided under a user\u2019s finger via vibration of a touch surface.", " Researchers have also explored the design of tactile feedback, but have found few benefits in targeting tasks [11, 24].", " McAdam and Brewster hypothesize that benefits of distal vibrotactile feedback may be reduced due to target size, since Fitts\u2019s Law shows that as target size increases, they become easier to acquire, i.e.", " if targets are large enough, tactile feedback may not be required [24].", " Thus, we see benefit in studying a standard Fitts\u2019s law task, usingmore challenging targets to acquire, to further explore the distal feedback phenomenon."], [" One open question when designing vibrotactile feedback is the form that vibrotactile feedback should take.", " Should a device vibrate when the user enters the target, then stop, or should the device continue to vibrate continuously while a user is within the target?", " Inspired by past work Zhang et al.", " [36] on vibrotactile feedback, we conducted an initial pilot study to evaluate four different feedback conditions: no feedback, fill feedback, center feedback (where 1/4 of the target provided feedback to guide participants to the center of the target and reduce errors), and line leading edge feedback (see Figure 2).", " For the pilot study, participants performed a short Fitts\u2019s Law experiment [33] with three target sizes (3.8mm, 7.6mm and 12.6mm) and two different amplitudes (32mm and 64mm).", " The specific devices used in our study were a Nexus 6P smartphone running Android 7.1.2 (14.5 cm display, 1440 by 2560 pixels at 518 dpi), and a Sony Smartwatch 3 running Android Wear 1.5.0.", " To assess feedback, we conducted a semi-structured interview with participants after the pilot study, exploring which interaction techniques they preferred, and their impressions of vibrotactile feedback and the use of the watch for feedback.", " We also collected timing information.", " RM-ANOVAS indicated that there was no significant effect of condition on elapsed time (F1.061,15.917 = 1.032,p = ns,\u03b72 = 0.00179), or condition on error rate (F1.061,15.917 = 1.12,p = ns,\u03b72 = 0.00195).", " This analysis suggests that the techniques were comparable and error rates differed only marginally between techniques.", " We also examined survey results to uncover user preferences.", " While we found that participants preferred vibrotactile feedback on the smartphone, the smartwatch was also highly rated in comments.", " In terms of the specific haptic feedback conditions, participants found the fill technique the easiest to use overall because it provided constant feedback when over the target (i.e.", " participants were not required to search for the actual target on the display).", " Alongside understanding how best to apply vibrotactile effects, one strongly positive result from our study is that participants highlighted no perceived difficulties in integrating distal watch feedback from the non-dominant arm with on-screen interaction.", " One participant noted that, as he interacted with small targets using the watch, he became convinced that we were also doing \u201csomething with the phone too\u201d and, when re-assured that we were not, that the watch and phone were distinct, he noted that it was \u201camazing how fast [we] re-wired [his] brain\u201d (to associate the distal feedback to an interaction location location).", " The promising results from this pilot study motivated a more complete study of smartwatch-based vibrotactile feedback."], [" We compare interaction location vibrotactile feedback (i.e.", " under the finger) to distal vibrotactile feedback

our application and logging (described below) and ran the full experimental protocol.", " In this initial experiment, we found that the smartphone was slightly faster than the smartwatch, by about 30 to 50ms.", " We hypothesized that this delay might be due to transmission delays of the Bluetooth connection between smartphone and smartwatch during the distal condition.", " While the delay", " could reasonably be expected in distal vibrotactile feedback applications, we decided to add a fourth condition to the experiment (interaction location feedback with simulated Bluetooth delay).", " Even small delays in feedback can have significant impacts on performance, so adding Bluetooth delay to the smartphone allows us to account for this delay.", " Bluetooth delay was calculated as half of the round trip time for inter-device communication, approximately 39ms.", " We discarded the data from our initial experiment and reran our experiment with four factors.", " With this change, our

future work, is to ask the question what if, instead, behaviour were different when feedback was present and targeting was difficult?", " For example, if the user simply gave up, realizing the targeting task was too difficult, and did not even particularly try to acquire small targets for the control condition, then the speed accuracy condition in control would break down and all points would be below the Fitts\u2019s line.", " If, in vibrotactile conditions, the user, instead, assumed that they could complete the difficult task, then they might feel around, subtly try to position their finger, then recognize that the task was extremely hard and that their error rate was high, but that interaction was still possible.", " Thus, again, Fitts\u2019s law might partially break down, but in the opposite way: because of errors, the participants would be biased toward being more careful and points would exist above the line [35].", " An additional issue to explore is whether vibrotactile feedback is worthwhile at all for typical targeting tasks.", " If we examine Figure 8, one thing that is clear is that the effect of feedback on error rate is marginal for targets larger than 6.3mm in size.", " This is undoubtedly because visual feedback is sufficient to ensure contact with target, a result previously hypothesized by McAdam and Brewster [24].", " However, does this mean that vibrotactile feedback, where the phone vibrates when buttons are pressed, is to be avoided?", " We would argue that it does not.", " While there is no temporal or error rate advantage to vibrotactile feedback for these conditions, there is also no penalty.", " Furthermore, it does provide the user with confidence, during interaction, that the button was acquired and pressed, potentially allowing them to go on to the next task without awaiting on-screen confirmation.", " Due to the density of on-screen widgets in feature-rich smartphone applications, and to its ability to provide non-visual confirmation, we feel there exists a value to feedback that extends beyond raw time and error-rate values.", " This paper focused primarily on one type of distal vibrotactile feedback, provided by a smartwatch worn on the nondominant hand during dominant-hand interaction.", " Clearly a myriad of other distal vibration devices can be conceptualized: users could hold their phone in their non-preferred handwhile interacting; users couldwear their smartwatch on their dominant hand such that the vibration would be closer to the locus of interaction; we could design custom jewelry such as a wristband, ring, earring, necklace, or even use a piece of clothing; the device could be in the user\u2019s pocket instead of in their hand; we could build complex external hardware

respect to time, error, and user preference.", " Alongside additional contact locations, another avenue of future work could explore distal vibrotactile feedback in multi-user scenarios.", " Multi-user scenarios are a strong motivational factor for distal feedback because, when multiple users interact with a single screen, it becomes challenging to vibrate only a portion of the screen under a single user\u2019s finger.", " Furthermore, when multiple users \u2013 beyond two, for example \u2013 all interact simultaneously, the need, to selectively provide tailored feedback for a subset of users further exacerbates hardware design challenges.", " Extending our exploration to this multi-user interaction is a clear next step."], [" Current vibrotactile hardware, while effective in providing simple feedback, cannot typically handle multi-user scenarios nor projected display scenarios (particularly when the projected surface is an inanimate artifact such as a wall or an artificial surface as in augmented or virtual reality).", " In these situations, it makes sense to leverage other existing devices that can offer vibrotactile feedback.", " Smartwatches, in particular, seem well-positioned to support interaction; they are readily available, and, without repositioning or grasping, can immediately be used to interact with external computation such that vibrotactile feedback from the watch can be used as a proxy for under-finger feedback.", " Our experiment demonstrates that the effects of distal feedback provided by the smartwatch are virtually identical to interaction location feedback on the touchscreen \u2013 particularly once Bluetooth delay is incorporated into the feedback.", " These results \u2013 in particular, the fact that distal

", "So vibrotactile feedback is very typical for touchscreens and the reason for this is that we've kind of shifted devices with physical buttons like this Nokia phone here to devices with touchscreens that kind of have these virtual buttons and virtual keys don't really have tangible feedback so we use vibrotactile feedback to kind of combat that so it gives the user confidence that they've actually pressed a button. ", "So, there's been research that's looked at tactile feedback for targeting starting with Cockburn mostly who showed that multimodal feedback was effective for hitting small targets. Brewster and Hoggan have also both looked at the effectiveness of tactile feedback for mobile interactions and they've basically showed that they help users in accuracy. ", "So specifically our paper is looking at distal vibrotactile feedback. So, we're motivated by situations where interaction location feedback might not be available so for example, if you have multiple users using a display it doesn't really make sense to vibrate the entire display or if the display is projected in air, it's kind of impracticable to have vibration motors in the air. ", "So this idea of using another location for feedback is not new, McAdam and Maeda looked at vibrating wrists on the same hand that's interacting and the premise of this is basically is the wrist is vibrating, the vibration will propagate to the hand so you get kind of this virtual feedback while you're interacting. Tankana also looked at using vibration on the non-dominant hand's fingers to understand what's going on while using a pair or forceps with your dominant hand, particularly in computer-enhanced surgical procedures. ", "So a lot of these systems in the literature, like McAdam, Maeda and Tankana, they all use specialized vibration systems but what we're curious about is if you can support this dominant hand interaction with vibrotactile feedback from a commodity smart watch on the non-dominant hand or the non-dominant wrist and we wanted to look at this for two reasons. First, there's an advantage to doing it this way. It's convenient, these devices are broadly available and a lot of people understand what they're doing and their purpose. Second, a lot of vibrotactile feedback techniques have been explored on the wrist of the same hand that people are interacting with which is actually not where these devices are typically worn and we were also not aware of any previous literature that looks at this opposing location as a location for vibrotactile feedback. ", "So that's the question we're asking in this paper, can we use a convenience device, like a smartwatch, to provide distal vibrotactile feedback as a proxy for interaction location feedback? ", "So in our study we used two devices. We uses a Huawei Nexus 6P smartphone where the user would interact and receive vibration feedback and then for distal feedback we used a Sony SmartWatch 3 where people would receive feedback upon acquiring target on the mobile phone. Each device used an ERM vibration motor which is basically just a standard vibration motor on the commodity devices and we used Bluetooth to facilitate communication between the smartphone and the smartwatch. ", "So before we ran the main study, one of the big questions we wanted to ask is how do we actually provide this vibrotactile feedback? So do we provide vibration while the user's finger is within the entire target? Do we try and get the user to move closer to the center of the target and vibrate there in order to reduce errors by them lifting off? Do we tell the user that they've entered the target by just vibrating near the edges or do we not give them feedback at all? So we actually did a quick test using a Fitts's ISO Task to compare the distal feedback to interaction location feedback. ", "And what we found is that essentially, participants seemed to prefer this fill style of feedback across both the watch and phone conditions. Participants also rated both the watch, or distal feedback, and phone, or interaction location feedback, quite highly which showed promise for exploring these further and one participant particularly noted that they felt it was amazing that we were able to rewire their brain to associate this distal feedback to an interaction location so that gave some merit for studying this further. ", "So after the pilot we fleshed out an experimental design. So to reiterate, our goal is to assess how distal vibrotactile feedback or smartwatch feedback compares to interaction location vibrotactile feedback, or under the finger feedback. And from the pilot we determined that fill feedback was most appropriate. We also had some other design considerations and these were that we wanted to look at smaller targets and this is because of the literature. Vibration feedback is generally more beneficial for these smaller targets so we figured that was a good point to look at and also we wanted to look at the cost associated with Bluetooth delay for communicating feedback to the watch so in other words, what is the cost of moving the feedback to a distal location? Including the time costs of sending the message to start the vibration and do the benefits outweigh this cost? ", "So this led us to the following experimental design. So first of all we have a series of target sizes that are inspired by typical target sizes on a mobile device. So one and two centimeters are fairly large mobile targets and one centimeter is similar to the home button here at the bottom. 6.3 millimeters is actually drawn from Android guidelines which is typically the smallest recommended button size and then we have three smaller sizes. So 3.2 millimeters was about the size of a text key, 1.3 millimeters which is approximately the inner word spacing in a line of text and 1.9 millimeters which is approximately the height of a line of text before zooming. So this gave us six different target sizes that we were investigating. ", "So the experimental task was a Fitts's ISO Task so basically participants were instructed to select the blue target as the starting point, they were to move their index finger from the blue target to the red target and then lift their finger once it was within the red target and this is when they received the vibrotactile feedback. Text feedback was also provided at the top left hand corner just to indicate whether or not the participant had completed the selection correctly. ", "Alongside this we had four conditions, so we had interaction location or phone feedback as condition one, we had phone feedback plus delay which was a Bluetooth delay which we calculated as 39 milliseconds as condition two and we have distal or watch feedback as condition three and then no feedback as a control condition or condition four. ", "So in our evaluation we had the following hypotheses, we hypothesize that vibrotactile feedback will improve targeting time compared to no feedback. As well, this is largely due to the user having an additional indicator of acquiring a target so we expect them to be faster. Second, we expect vibrotactile feedback to lower error rate compared to no feedback. Again, because the user has this additional indicator of acquiring the target. Lastly, we expect participants to prefer feedback conditions over no feedback for the reasons I said prior and we do expect people to prefer the phone feedback over watch feedback, largely because they're used to it. ", "So this just kind of summarizes what we did, we had a within-subjects design, 16 participants and it was counter balanced using a Latin Square design and basically we just collected over 23,000 targeting tasks to evaluate the phenomenon. ", "So moving on to results of our study, time was actually our most surprising result since we thought that feedback would improve time but we actually found the opposite. So the graph on the left here depicts average time to acquire a target on the y axis, via target width on the x axis. So what we found was that no feedback, gray on the graph, was actually faster than feedback and in particular much faster for small targets and that phone with delay and watch feedback were statistically significantly slower than no feedback. So no feedback is a shorter time but then as the targets get larger they all kind of converge on the same time so no benefit really either way and we were really interested in investigating what might be going on here so we looked at it a bit further. ", "So we broke these results down into a Fitts's Law analysis. These graphs are scatter plots, the average time selected target by Fitts's IDs for each condition. We drew a line of best fit for targets greater than or equal to 3.2 millimeters which are just typical target sizes on mobile devices and I'm gonna highlight two main components of this slide. So first, looking at targets from two centimeters to 3.2 millimeters you kinda see all of these targets following a standard Fitts's Law behavior in terms of time. It doesn't really appear that feedback harms performance time in any of these typical targets. But then when you look at exceptionally small targets such as 1.3 millimeters or 1.9 millimeters you can see Fitts's Law sort of break down. And you can see in the no feedback conditions, average time for these small targets lie exclusively below the line of best fit but in the feedback conditions average times lie exclusively above the line of best fit. And this is interesting because while we can't really measure what's going on in people's minds while they're interacting, we think that they might have felt like they actually could succeed when there was feedback there but when there was no feedback they kind of just gave up which is why the time kind of just went up. ", "We can see this as well a little bit in errors. The graph here depicts error rate by target width and you'll notice that error rate drops as targets (coughing) and we found that with feedback people are more accurate and particularly that in phone with delay and watch feedback people are statistically significantly more accurate than no feedback. 1.3 millimeters and 1.9 millimeter targets are still very difficult to hit on a smartphone as they're much smaller than a finger but you'll notice that people actually think they can hit them and so oftentimes they do which we see in this small little difference in error rate and so we attribute this to people actually trying to hit the target. ", "The last thing that we looked at was user preference. The graph here depicts distribution of participants by preference ranking. So we see that people value feedback. No feedback being rated least preferred by 14 out of 16 of our participants. Also, one participant rated no feedback first, which you can see in the gray bar of the first bar and they said they chose no feedback first because they were more frustrated when they got it wrong when there was feedback there so essentially, if they were going to fail they would rather fail with no feedback. ", "So what's next for this research? So to sort of wrap up a little bit, as these interactive displays become more ubiquitous such as virtual displays projected onto a surface or in air, we wonder if this vibration feedback, particularly when it's applied distally, will also assist in target acquisition? Especially since these surfaces may be less familiar for interaction. Multi user scenarios are also a clear use case after this phenomenon so we think it makes sense to explore that next. Additionally, clearly we can imagine other places where you could provide distal vibrotactile feedback such as your phone in your pocket, on smart glasses, on your headphones or other wearables but we figure that as smartwatches are one of the most popular wearables now that their assessment was a good starting point. So we're also wondering if we could perhaps redesign vibrotactile feedback using the second type of feedback, which in our pilot study to kind of guide the user to the center of the target. This way, when they lift off they're less likely to lift off outside of the target and more likely to actually acquire it. ", "So to conclude, we present a Fitts's Law analysis of distal vibrotactile feedback via a smartwatch and thus we conclude that distal vibrotactile feedback via smartwatch can serve as an effective proxy for this interaction location feedback.
